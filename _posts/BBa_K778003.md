ArgBox8

# Part:BBa_K778003

Designed by: Yuka Yamazaki   Group: iGEM12_UT-Tokyo   (2012-09-23)

ArgR binding sites （including 8 binding sites）

ArgR binding sites (including 8 Argboxes) for inhibition of ArgR (repressor).

Tokyo tech 2011 made biobrick part which includes only 1 Argbox
[Part:BBa_K649401](/Part:BBa_K649401 "Part:BBa K649401") . We (UT-Tokyo 2012)
improved this part designing new, stronger biobrick part that includes 8
Argboxes. Increased number of Argboxes will lead to more inhibition of ArgR.

In addition, you can make more powerful inhibitor of ArgR by combining 2 or
more of this biobrick part like [Part:BBa_K778006](/Part:BBa_K778006 "Part:BBa
K778006") which includes 16 Argboxes.
