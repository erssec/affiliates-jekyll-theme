# Part:BBa_K519010

Designed by: Kotone Miyake   Group: iGEM11_Tokyo-NoKoGen   (2011-09-30)

SmtA

SmtA is a metallothionein that can bind to heavy metal ions such as Cd(II).
This SmtA is cloned from _Synechococcus_ sp. PCC7942, a cyanobacterial strain.
SmtA is a type II metallothionein with a reduced cys content.It was reported
that marine cyanobacterium that does not originally harbor a homologous gene,
when genetically engineered to express SmtA, could tolerate medium containing
Cd(II), Zn(II) and Cu(II) (Sode _et al_., 1998).

The data above, taken from a paper (Sode _et al._ , 1988), shows that a
cyanobacterial strain was able to tolerate medium of high Cd(II) concentration
when it harbored the _smtA_ gene.

  

For our iGEM project this year, we have successfully observed that SmtA,
expressed under a constitutive promoter (J23109) work very well. We plotted a
graph of growth rate by looking at the OD595 every 1 hour, and compared the
growth of wild type _E. coli_ and SmtA expressing _E. coli_. As a result, we
found that _E. coli_ expressing SmtA grow better than the WT _E. coli_ at a
high Cd(II) concentration.

## Functional Parameters: Austin_UTexas

### Burden Imposed by this Part:

![](http://parts.igem.org/wiki/images/f/fa/T--Austin_Utexas--
no_burden_icon.png)

**Burden Value: -0.1 ± 3.9%**

Burden is the percent reduction in the growth rate of _E. coli_ cells
transformed with a plasmid containing this BioBrick (± values are 95%
confidence limits). This BioBrick did not exhibit a burden that was
significantly greater than zero (i.e., it appears to have little to no impact
on growth). Therefore, users can depend on this part to remain stable for many
bacterial cell divisions and in large culture volumes. Refer to any one of the
[BBa_K3174002](http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K3174002) \-
[BBa_K3174007](http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K3174007) pages for more
information on the methods, an explanation of the sources of burden, and other
conclusions from a large-scale measurement project conducted by the [2019
Austin_UTexas team](http://2019.igem.org/Team:Austin_UTexas).

This functional parameter was added by the [2020 Austin_UTexas
team.](http://2020.igem.org/Team:Austin_UTexas/Contribution)
