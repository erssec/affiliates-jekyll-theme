# Part:BBa_K592027

Designed by: Lei Sun   Group: iGEM11_Uppsala-Sweden   (2011-09-21)

  
T5-lac promoter-B0032-BFP

The promoter T5-lac
([BBa_K592008](http://parts.igem.org/wiki/index.php/Part:BBa_K592008)) for
testing its promoter strength coupled with BFP
([BBa_K592100](http://parts.igem.org/wiki/index.php/Part:BBa_K592100)). This
construct should be cloned into pSB3K3 plasmid to measure the BFP output and
thereby determine the promoter strength. Theoretically, the promoter should be
well-repressed in LacIq strain but inducible by high concentrations of IPTG.
