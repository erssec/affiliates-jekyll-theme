Anabaena pSac Promoter

Anabaena vegetative cell promoter, linked to photosystem I. Can be used to
express specifically in vegetative cells, excluding heterocyst expression.

This promoter sequence is derived from a region upstream of the pSac operon in
Anabaena 7120. The operon belongs to photosystem I; therefore the promoter's
activity is effectively constitutive in that organism, in growth conditions.
However, Anabaena has the important characteristic of cell differentiation
under nitrogen deficient conditions, forming non-photosynthetic cells called
heterocysts. The more common vegetative cell type will express genes under
control of the pSac promoter, but the heterocyst cells will not.

We transformed Anabaena 7120 with a construct containing GFP reporter
controlled by psaC promoter part BBa_K656010. Bright field light micrograph
and GFP filter images are compared to demonstrate fluorescence of a successful
transformant. Red arrows point to heterocyst cells containing noticeably less
fluorescence.
