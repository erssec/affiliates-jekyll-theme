# Part:BBa_K523006

Designed by: Mun Ching Lee, Sylvia Ispasanie, Allan Crossman   Group:
iGEM11_Edinburgh   (2011-07-29)

Plac + LacZ + malS

_E. coli_ periplasmic α-amylase gene _malS_ (see [info from GenBank:
U00096.2](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/48994873?from=3735520&to=3737550&report=gbwithparts))
under control of lac promoter. LacZα is also present.

### Usage and Biology

While an amylase ought to be capable of degrading starch, the product protein
is believed to be periplasmic and thus ought to only degrade starch if it
leaks from the periplasm in significant quantities (but see below: this does
seem to be the case). Its natural function in _E. coli_ presumably involves
degrading shorter glucose chains: [Lengsfeld _et al_
(2008)](http://dx.doi.org/10.1128/JB.00767-08) state that "MalS produces
preferentially maltohexaose from longer maltodextrins in the periplasm".

Other interesting and useful facts about the MalS protein can be found in
[Spiess _et al_ (1997)](http://dx.doi.org/10.1074/jbc.272.35.22125).

The SignalP program predicts that a 17 amino acid localisation signal (at the
N terminal) is cleaved off before the protein reaches its mature form.

#### Iodine assay #1

We (Edinburgh 2011) placed
[BBa_K523001](http://parts.igem.org/wiki/index.php/Part:BBa_K523001) under the
control of the lac promoter (creating
[BBa_K523006](http://parts.igem.org/wiki/index.php/Part:BBa_K523006)) and
streaked colonies on a starch agar plate. A (poorly characterised) negative
control without this construct was also streaked out. The cells were incubated
for 3 days.

One colony failed to grow for some reason, but the others did. We flooded the
plate with iodine, which turns black in the presence of starch
([Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iodine_test)):

[![523001-assay-pre2.jpg](/wiki/images/thumb/0/03/523001-assay-
pre2.jpg/200px-523001-assay-pre2.jpg)](/File:523001-assay-pre2.jpg) |  |
[![523001-assay-post.jpg](/wiki/images/thumb/1/11/523001-assay-
post.jpg/200px-523001-assay-post.jpg)](/File:523001-assay-post.jpg) |  |
[![523001-assay-post-post2.jpg](/wiki/images/thumb/8/86/523001-assay-post-
post2.jpg/200px-523001-assay-post-post2.jpg)](/File:523001-assay-post-
post2.jpg)  
---|---|---|---|---  
Before the assay. Colony 1 failed to grow. **Control at top.** |  |
Immediately after iodine flooding.  |  |  40 minutes after iodine flooding.  
  
We made three observations:

  1. The area under the negative control (top streak) turned black, while the areas under the _malS_ streaks did not.
  2. The iodine gradually evaporated, turning the plate clear again.
  3. After 40 minutes, halos were seen around the two _malS_ streaks.

We can think of two ways to explain observation 1:

  * _malS_ degraded starch, or:
  * the control cells grew slower than the _malS_ cells for some reason, and thus formed a thinner layer; iodine could pass through that layer to turn the starch underneath black, but could not pass through the thicker _malS_ layer.

However, observation 3, the halos, seem to rule out this second explanation,
and instead suggest actual diffusion of a starch-degrading enzyme (MalS) into
the agar.

#### Iodine assay #2

The precise nature of the negative control above has been lost in the mists of
time (it was JM109 _E. coli_ with an unknown construct in pSB1C3).

We (Edinburgh 2011) repeated the iodine assay with a known control, PlacLacZ-
bglX (part
[BBa_K523014](http://parts.igem.org/wiki/index.php/Part:BBa_K523014)). This
part is a good control since it has both Plac-LacZ (like this part) and a
periplasmic protein (like this part), and is known to actually work.

(Another control, using only Plac-LacZ, failed to grow because the source
cells had been in the cold room too long.)

---|---|---|---|---  
Control at top. Bottom two streaks are _malS_.  |  | Same plate, time = 25
minutes.  |  | Same plate, time = 70 minutes. While the iodine has faded from
all the bacteria, halos are now visible around the _malS_ streaks but not the
control.  
  
#### DNS assay

We (Edinburgh 2011) made cell extracts using this part and compared them to a
negative control
([BBa_K523000](http://parts.igem.org/wiki/index.php/Part:BBa_K523000)) in the
following way:

Cells were sonicated and fractionated to obtain cell lysate and cell debris.
0.2% starch solution and phosphate buffered saline (PBS) were mixed with cell
extract and incubated at 37 C. Every 30 minutes, a sample was taken from the
reaction and 3,5-dinitrosalicylic acid (DNS) was added. The sample was heated
in boiling water for 10 minutes. Enzyme activity was then halted by addition
of potassium tartrate. The sample was cooled to room temperature and OD575 was
measured.

If the cell extract is capable of starch degradation, this will cause the
liberated glucose to react with the DNS, producing 3-amino,5-nitrosalicylic
acid and so increasing the OD575 reading. The data are clearest for the cell
lysate, but overall seem to indicate starch degradation:

Left side shows data for 2 experiments (and 2 controls) using cell lysate;
right side shows data for cell debris (CD).

#### Mucoid phenotype

Streaks of _E. coli_ with this part, and grown on starch agar, eventually show
a mucoid phenotype so pronounced they were described as "disgusting" by a
hardened microbiologist. This phenotype is only visible after several days,
and was first spotted on plates that had already been subjected to iodine
treatment, so we (Edinburgh 2011) checked plates that were never subjected to
iodine. These too show the effect:

[![K523006-mucoid-2011-09-16.jpg](/wiki/images/thumb/f/fe/K523006-mucoid-2011-09-16.jpg/300px-K523006-mucoid-2011-09-16.jpg)](/File:K523006-mucoid-2011-09-16.jpg)

---|---|---  
Starch agar. Mucoid (slimy) phenotype. All colonies are _malS_.  |  | Same
plate, held up to the light. Control failed to grow because it wasn't
chloramphenicol resistant. Oops.  
  
#### Mucoid phenotype "transmission"

We (Edinburgh 2011) wanted to check that a control strain of _E. coli_ without
this part doesn't display a mucoid phenotype on starch agar, and so _E. coli_
with the aforementioned Plac-bglX part
([BBa_K523014](http://parts.igem.org/wiki/index.php/Part:BBa_K523014)) was
streaked out onto a starch agar plate alongside some more _malS_ streaks.

We noticed an interesting fact: whether the control strain showed a mucoid
phenotype depended on how close the cells were to the _malS_ streaks. The part
of the streak that was close to a _malS_ streak did, while the part that was
furthest away did not.

[![K523006-slime-transmission.jpg](/wiki/images/thumb/2/25/K523006-slime-
transmission.jpg/400px-K523006-slime-transmission.jpg)](/File:K523006-slime-
transmission.jpg)  
---  
The new starch agar plate. As before, one of the controls (top) failed to grow
due to an extended period in the cold room.  
  
This seems to suggest that the MalS protein, or its products, are diffusing
through the agar, and causing the nearby cells to show the same mucoid
phenotype.

#### Growth on (minimal) starch agar

The starch agar mentioned above also had other carbon sources present. We
tested the ability of K523006 to grow on minimal media but with only starch
added as a carbon source. Indeed it could, while normal _E. coli_ displayed
weak or no growth:

[![K523006 on
starch.jpg](/wiki/images/thumb/e/e9/K523006_on_starch.jpg/400px-K523006_on_starch.jpg)](/File:K523006_on_starch.jpg)  
---  
Growth on M9 minimal media with starch.  
  
#### Future experiments: Mucoid phenotype on LB agar

A control ought to be run testing whether this part displays the mucoid
phenotype on normal agar. On the assumption that this phenotype is related to
starch degradation, it should not.

We ([TecCEM_HS 2015](http://2015.igem.org/Team:TecCEM_HS/Parts)) ran this
experiment to see the phenotype difference between the bacteria that have
BBa_K523006 in starch agar and in normal LB agar (no starch). There wasn't any
mucoid phenotype to be seen on LB agar in comparison to starch agar, which
showed the mucoid phenotype. We can observe that the mucoid phenotype that is
shown by _E.coli_ is in fact related to the ability of this part to degrade
starch.

---|---|---  
Starch agar after Iodine assay. Mucoid phenotype can be seen.  |  | LB (Cam+)
agar, the phenotype is not mucoid. All colonies contain BBa_K523006.  
  
### Discussion

There is clear evidence that _malS_ , when expressed from a high copy number
plasmid, is capable of at least mild starch degradation.

The mucoid phenotype was unexpected. It is possible that starch degradation
has led to a high supply of glucose, leading to extra exopolysaccharide being
produced. This might also explain the "transmission" of the phenotype to
nearby cells.

China), Designed by: Xin Ma.

## Characterisation by 2019 Hong Kong UCCKE Team

Group: iGEM 2019 Hong Kong UCCKE  
Author: Wong Annabelle  
Summary: We conducted an assay to compare the catalytic activity on starch of
BBa_K23006 clones with 1% amylase solution. Results are recorded in 3 days
with the help of iodine solution.

#### Purpose

Team Edinburgh conducted 2 iodine assays to compare the catalytic activity of
BBa_K23006 colonies with a negative control and a known control PlacLacZ-bglX,
which proved the ability of malS to degrade starch. Therefore, we undertook
the experiment by comparing the catalytic activity of BBa_K23006 on starch
with a positive control, 1% amylase solution.

#### Methods

We transferred a spot of clone of BBa_K23006 and a spot of 1% amylase on
opposite sides of the starch agar plate. The cells were incubated for three
days at 37℃. Every day, we flooded the plate with iodine, and measured the
diameter of clear zone formed by the two samples respectively.  
The protocol can be found in our wiki page:
<https://2019.igem.org/Team:Hong_Kong_UCCKE/Contribution>

#### Results

Day 1 | Day 2 | Day 3  
---|---|---

Graph 1.The diameter of clear zone of α-amylase and 1% amylase

From the results, a clear zone and growth of halos around the clone can be
observed under iodine solution, which corresponds with the former conclusion
that malS can degrade starch. In comparison, 1% amylase solution showed a
greater initial starch degradation amount. Yet it’s slope of diameter of clear
zone almost levels off in day 3, which suggests that the rate of digestion
slows down with time. In contrast, the clones showed a steeper increase in the
diameter of clear zone from Day 2 to 3. This can be explained by the
continuous production of malS which results in a continuous digestion of
starch in the long run.

## VIT_Vellore Characterization: Expression

#### Methods

We decided that one facet of our characterization will be in the manipulation
of expression levels in bacteria for the chosen enzyme. This is because a high
volume of production can help us obtain more samples that can be used for
further processing. So we decided to optimize the production of the enzyme in
_E.coli_ by modifying three different growth affecting factors: pH, Carbon
source and nitrogen source. We chose these factors as they are the most
important factors in any media. Following incubation at 37°C overnight we
lysed the cells using ultrasonication, spun it down to remove the debris, and
used 0.5ml of the lysate for all our experiments. DNS assay enzyme incubation
conditions were changed as required.

#### Results and Interpretation

**_Media optimization: pH_**

  

  

_Observations and Inference_  
As expected, 7 is the optimum pH for amylase production.

![Name](https://2019.igem.org/wiki/images/a/ad/T--VIT_Vellore--charPh.png)

  

**_Media optimization: Nitrogen source_**

  

S.no |  | Nitrogen Source |  | Activity  
---|---|---  
1 | Yeast extract | 1.633  
2 | Malt extract | 0.908  
3 | Beef extract | 14.492  
4 | Peptone | 1.183  
  
  
  

![Name](https://2019.igem.org/wiki/images/4/4e/T--VIT_Vellore--
charNitrogen.png)

  
  

_Observations and Inference_  
As we can clearly see, beef extract is the most optimum nitrogen source for
amylase expression.

  
  

  

**_Media optimization: Carbon source_**

  
  

S.no |  | Carbon Source |  | Activity  
---|---|---  
1 | Dextrose | 0.433  
2 | Starch | 3.591  
3 | Sucrose | 7.483  
4 | Fructose | 4.867  
  
  
  

![Name](https://2019.igem.org/wiki/images/e/e1/T--VIT_Vellore--charCarbon.png)

  
  

_Observations and Inference_  
We can thus conclude that Sucrose is the optimum carbon source for amylase
expression.

  
  

## VIT_Vellore Characterization: Activity

**pH effect**  

We decided to use DNS assay as it will give a reliable estimate of the
activity of the of the enzyme. We decided to check the effect of temperature
and pH on the activity of the enzyme. Similar to the expression
characterization, we obtained the cell lysate using ultrasonication and
centrifugation which was later used for the assay. For the effect of pH on
activity, the cell lysates obtained were mixed with mild acids or bases and
appropriate buffers were added to maintain the pH in the range of 3 to 9. The
list of buffers used can be found
[here](https://2019.igem.org/Team:VIT_Vellore/Characterization). To these
solutions, DNS assay was performed. <p/>  
_Results_  
<p>It is clearly evident pH 7 is the ideal condition for the enzyme to
function. At pH even slightly higher than this, a sharp drop in activity is
observed. Even at lower pH, activity remains significantly low.

![Name](https://2019.igem.org/wiki/images/9/95/T--VIT_Vellore--charPh2.png)  

**Temperature effect**  

Similar to the pH characterization, temperature characterization was done by
collecting the lysates and incubating them in temperatures ranging from 0°C to
80°C for five minutes. These solutions were later used for DNS assay.

![Name](https://2019.igem.org/wiki/images/1/10/T--VIT_Vellore--charTemp.png)  
_Results:_

The maximum activity is found to be at 24°C and we notice a sharp decline in
activity as the temperature reduces. However it was not as steep as we had
initially expected. Though the activity decreases much gradually as the
temperature increases.

### Burden Imposed by this Part:

![](http://parts.igem.org/wiki/images/f/fa/T--Austin_Utexas--
no_burden_icon.png) **Burden Value: 9.6 ± 17.9%**

Burden is the percent reduction in the growth rate of _E. coli_ cells
transformed with a plasmid containing this BioBrick (± values are 95%
confidence limits). This BioBrick did not exhibit a burden that was
significantly greater than zero (i.e., it appears to have little to no impact
on growth). Therefore, users can depend on this part to remain stable for many
bacterial cell divisions and in large culture volumes. Refer to any one of the
