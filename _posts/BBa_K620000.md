# Part:BBa_K620000

Designed by: Caltech iGEM 2011   Group: iGEM11_Caltech   (2011-09-20)

DDT Dehydrochlorinase

Also known as Glutathione S-transferase 1-1, this protein is supposed to
degrade DDT, an endocrine disruptor and persistent organic pollutant. The
protein was identified from the _Anopheles dirus_ mosquito by [Prapanthadara
et al](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0965174895000909) and
the gene was assembled from the protein's amino acid sequence, taken from
[NCBI's protein database](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/protein/Q93113.1), via
PIPE cloning.

DDT structure after reaction with DDT Dehydrochlorinase and GCMS with a
molecular weight of 206g/mole

As shown in the [GCMS of DDT without the degradation
enzyme](/File:DDT_blank.jpg "File:DDT blank.jpg"), there is a clear band at
235 g/mol. DDT's molar mass is 355. This indicates that the original
[structure](/File:Ddt.png "File:Ddt.png") loses a carbon and three chlorines
to form a [new structure](/File:MS1DDT235.png "File:MS1DDT235.png") with this
mass during the GCMS process. The [12.5 minute GC peak
](/File:Degraded_DDT_1.png "File:Degraded DDT 1.png") and the [16.5 minute GC
peak](/File:Ddtreact.png "File:Ddtreact.png") in the DDT-DDT dehydrochlorinase
reaction show a further degradation of DDT. The 16.5 minute peak showed an MS
peak at 206 g/mole. The degradation that could result in this weight involves
the loss of [two chlorines and a phenyl group](/File:MSDDT205.png
"File:MSDDT205.png"). There is another mass spec band in this reading at 191
g/mol, which we are still working to identify. In the 12.5 minute GC peak,
there are MS peaks at 133 g/mol and at 105 g/mol, which we are also still
working to identify. However, these two GC peaks are not present in analysis
of our reaction buffer with DDT and our reaction buffer with enzyme,
indicating that they result from a degradation reaction between DDT
dehydrochlorinase and DDT.
