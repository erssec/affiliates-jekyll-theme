cI repressor tagged with yBFP

This is the cI repressor from phage lambda tagged with yeast codon optimized
BFP. cI will bind to operators already present in the registry: (BBa_R0051 &
BBa_K105021). BFP is a monomeric fluorescent protein that has an excitation
peak of 399 nm and an emission peak of 465 nm (1). It was yeast codon
optimized through DNA synthesis for the purpose of expressing in _S.
cerevisiae_ tagged to various repressors and activators.
