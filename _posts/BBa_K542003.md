# Part:BBa_K542003

Designed by: Anthony Vuong   Group: iGEM11_Lethbridge   (2011-09-23)

pBAD Regulated TetR

Made by assembling
[BBa_I13453](http://parts.igem.org/wiki/index.php?title=Part:BBa_I13453) with
[BBa_P0440](http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_P0440).  
  
Production of TetR is regulated by the pBAD promoter
([BBa_I13453](http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_I13453)). TetR is an inhibitor of
the constitutively "on" promoter
pTet--[BBa_R0040](http://parts.igem.org/wiki/index.php?title=Part:BBa_R0040)).
Therefore, this part may be used in conjunction with the pTet promoter as an
"inverter"; pTet will be "turned off" in the presence of arabinose. (ie.
arabinose -> pBAD "on" -> TetR -> pTet "off")  
  
Intermediate part to assemble the "Co-localization Construct".
([BBa_K542008](http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K542008))  
  
This part was characterized in
[BBa_K542008](http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K542008) in _E. coli_ strain
DH5alpha to demonstrate its functionality as an intermediate in that
construct. The data sheet for BBa_K542008 is shown below.
