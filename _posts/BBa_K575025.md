# Part:BBa_K575025

Designed by: Kristin Palarz   Group: iGEM11_Northwestern   (2011-09-22)

LasR/PAI1 Inducible Promoter + RBS (B0030) + GFP, Constitutive Promoter + RBS
(B0034) + LasR

This construct contains a LasR/PaI1 (3-oxo-C12-HSL) inducible promoter with an
RBS and a GFP reporter. There is also constitutive transcription of the LasR
receptor protein. Thus, the promoter will activate and fluorescence will be
observed in the presence of PAI1.
