# Part:BBa_K741003

Designed by: Wuyang Chen   Group: iGEM12_USTC-China   (2012-07-24)

pRM-RBS-GFP-T

  
Promoter pRM with GFP gene downstream. The pRM is a modified one, whose OR3
(the third right operator) is mutated to be obliterated. This means our pRM is
relatively difficult to be repressed by Cro dimer and can always be activated
by CI dimer. We use this part to test the basic level of expression of
modified pRM.

Figure 2 shows that the fluorescence intensity of prm-gfp is so weak in
comparison with plac-gfp that we can assume that the leak expression of prm is
very few, which doesn't affect our experiments.
