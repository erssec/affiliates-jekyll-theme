This part should show similarity to
[BBa_K325219](http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K325219) [Add
Data](/Part:BBa_K325259:Experience "Part:BBa K325259:Experience")

  

**Description**  
This part is based on part
[BBa_K325219](http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K325219). Two site-directed
mutagenesis events have been carried out on the luciferase, an Asn286 Ser
mutation was used to create part
[BBa_K325209](http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K325209) which is the green wild-
type luciferase. Then a Pro452Ser mutation was used to create a yellow
bioluminescence.

  

## Colour of emission

Figure 1 - Comparison of part BBa_K325259 against other constructs created by
the E.glowli team. Note that this picture should be used as a relative
comparison rather than absolute colour. All images change markedly depending
on the white balance used.

  

**Compatibility**  
[_Chassis:_](http://parts.igem.org/cgi/partsdb/pgroup.cgi?pgroup=cell) Device
has been shown to work in _Top 10 (Invitrogen)_  
[_Plasmids:_](/Plasmid_backbones "Plasmid backbones") Device has been shown to
work on _[pSB1C3](http://parts.igem.org/wiki/index.php/Part:pSB1C3)_  

## Assembly standards

This part is based on Part
[BBa_K325219](http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K325219). We resynthesised this
part to remove three PstI restriction sites, making it compatible with
BioBrick assembly standards 10 and 23.

Unfortunately, in the process of mutagenesis to create the colour change a
SpeI site was introduced at site 3044. We have ordered primers to remove this
site by a substitution from T->C at base 3046. [BBa
K325259](/wiki/index.php?title=BBa_K325259&action=edit&redlink=1 "BBa K325259
\(page does not exist\)") (planning) will be the successor to this part
compatible with Assembly Standards 10 and 23. Unfortunately we did not have
time to complete this before the submission deadline, therefore the part will
be submitted during November 2010. In the meantime it is possible to use this
part with RFC 57.
