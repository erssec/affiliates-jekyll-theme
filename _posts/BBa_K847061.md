''Escherichia coli'' osmoregulatory trehalose synthesis B (otsB)

This gene encodes the second step to trehalose biosynthesis.

_Saccharomyces cerevisiae_ , baker’s yeast, is remarkably resistant to
desiccation, and it has been shown that certain osmoprotectant chemicals
accumulate in these cells when they desiccate. One of these chemicals is
trehalose, a disaccharide that was initially implicated in desiccation
resistance because of this accumulation (Calahan, Dunham, DeSevo, and Koshland
2011). Surprisingly, attempts to understand trehalose's role and effectiveness
in desiccation resistance have produced conflicting and inconsistent results
(Calahan et al. 2011).

The gram-negative biocontrol agent _Pantoea agglomerans_ was ineffective at
controlling blue mold on fruits because of its low viability during the long
periods of dehydration that it experienced during fruit processing (Bonaterra,
Camps, and Montesinos 2005). Its effectiveness was significantly increased
when it was engineered to accumulate both trehalose and glycine betaine during
desiccation, and it was hypothesized that these osmoprotectants “operate
through protection of membrane phospholipids by direct hydrogen bounding with
phospolipid head groups maintaining the liquid crystal state and stabilising
proteins by water replacement via hydrogen bounding” (Bonaterra, Camps, and
Montesinos 2005).
