# Part:BBa_K733001

Designed by: GU, Bida; SUN Fei   Group: iGEM12_HKUST_Hong_Kong   (2012-09-16)

_Ptms_ \- a constitutive promoter in _E. coli_ and _B. subtilis_.

_Ptms_ is a constitutive promoter that can be recognized by SigA factor in
_Bacillus subtilis_. Due to _E. coli_ ’s promiscuousness in recognizing
transcription and translation signals, _Ptms_ is also functional in _E. coli_.
According to some experiments, _Ptms_ shows quite low efficiency of
transcription in _B. subtilis_. ( Moran et al., 1982).

For the characterization of _Ptms_ , please refer to:

### Burden Imposed by this Part:

no_burden_icon.png)

**Burden Value: 6.3 ± 10.6%**

Burden is the percent reduction in the growth rate of _E. coli_ cells
transformed with a plasmid containing this BioBrick (± values are 95%
confidence limits). This BioBrick did not exhibit a burden that was
significantly greater than zero (i.e., it appears to have little to no impact
on growth). Therefore, users can depend on this part to remain stable for many
bacterial cell divisions and in large culture volumes. Refer to any one of the
[BBa_K3174002](http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K3174002) \-
[BBa_K3174007](http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K3174007) pages for more
information on the methods, an explanation of the sources of burden, and other
conclusions from a large-scale measurement project conducted by the [2019
Austin_UTexas team](http://2019.igem.org/Team:Austin_UTexas).

This functional parameter was added by the [2020 Austin_UTexas
team.](http://2020.igem.org/Team:Austin_UTexas/Contribution)
