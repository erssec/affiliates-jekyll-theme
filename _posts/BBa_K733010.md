# Part:BBa_K733010

Designed by: WANG, Yuqi   Group: iGEM12_HKUST_Hong_Kong   (2012-09-16)

_Ptms_ +RBS+ _ydcD_.

This construct contains a low efficient constitutive promoter _Ptms_ with an
antitoxin gene _ydcD (endB)_. The gene _ydcD_ can express a protein named
YdcD, which can counteract with a protein EndoA expressed by a toxin gene
_ydcE (ndoA)_. (Pellegrini et al., 2005) Besides, the low efficiency promoter
will contribute to the low level expression of YdcD.

### Functional Parameters

  

## Functional Parameters: Austin_UTexas

### Burden Imposed by this Part:

![](http://parts.igem.org/wiki/images/7/7a/T--Austin_Utexas--
high_significant_burden.png)

**Burden Value: 46.0 ± 6.2%**

Burden is the percent reduction in the growth rate of _E. coli_ cells
transformed with a plasmid containing this BioBrick (± values are 95%
confidence limits). This part exhibited a significant burden. Users should be
aware that BioBricks with a burden of >20-30% may be susceptible to mutating
to become less functional or nonfunctional as an evolutionary consequence of
this fitness cost. This risk increases as they used for more bacterial cell
divisions or in larger cultures. Users should be especially careful when
combining multiple burdensome parts, as plasmids with a total burden of >40%
are expected to mutate so quickly that they become unclonable. Refer to any
one of the [BBa_K3174002](http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K3174002) \-
[BBa_K3174007](http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K3174007) pages for more
information on the methods and other conclusions from a large-scale
measurement project conducted by the [2019 Austin_UTexas
team.](https://2019.igem.org/Team:Austin_UTexas)

This functional parameter was added by the [2020 Austin_UTexas
team.](https://2020.igem.org/Team:Austin_UTexas/Contribution)
