ChiPm-lacZ

# Part:BBa_K564013

Designed by: Anna Lewinska   Group: iGEM11_DTU_Denmark   (2011-09-20)

Upstream mutated chitoporin part fused with lacZ

ChiP encodes enterobacterial chitoporin required for uptake of chitin-derived
oligosaccharides. This outer membrane porin is required for Salmonella and
E.coli growth on chitooligosaccharides as a sole source of both carbon and
nitrogen. It is only synthesized in the presence of these substrates. In
nature it is regulated by sRNAs. In this biobrick we altered the ribosome
binding site for ChiP regulator – ChiX (AAGAGG-->AGGAGA). It was done in order
to show that the regulatory system depends on the specific base pairing
between ChiP and its regulator. The promoter and reporter have not been
altered compared to
[K564012](http://parts.igem.org/wiki/index.php?title=Part:BBa_K564012).

This was verified by β-gal assays as shown in the table below. The
measurements are in Miller Units
