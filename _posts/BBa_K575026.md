# Part:BBa_K575026

Designed by: Kristin Palarz   Group: iGEM11_Northwestern   (2011-09-22)

LasR/PAI1 Inducible Promoter + RBS (B0030) + RFP, Constitutive Promoter + RBS
(B0030) + LasR

This construct contains a LasR/PaI1 (3-oxo-C12-HSL) inducible promoter with an
RBS and an RFP reporter. There is also constitutive transcription of the LasR
receptor protein. Thus, the promoter will activate and fluorescence will be
observed in the presence of PAI1.

[Team RMHS_Maryland 2018](http://2018.igem.org/Team:RMHS_Maryland) contributed
to the characterization of this part by demonstrating that the part produces
RFP expression when induced by AI-1.

_RESULTS_  
Team RMHS_Maryland 2018 obtained characterization data for this construct in a
BL21 _E. coli_ chassis (BL21 is a strain that produces a constant high level
of AI-2). Overnight cultures of BL21 transformed with BBa_K575026 on the
standard backbone pSB1C3 were grown and diluted 50x in LB media. AI-1 was
added and fluorescence microscope images were taken at time intervals 1.5, 3
and 4 hours after initial incubation with AI-1. Percent of cells fluorescing
was determined by dividing the cell count under the fluorescence microscope
with the cell count under brightfield.  
  
Although it may be clearly observed that fluorescence is relatively minimal
even when AI-1 is added, the data indicates that the promoter is, as in part
BBa_K575024, not prone to leaky expression, and that RFP expression does in
fact occur. The percent fluorescence increased a great deal between 3 and 4
hours after incubation, but even at 1.5 and 3 hours it is evident from the
microscope images that there were at least a few cells fluorescing, indicating
that, although it would likely not serve as a very good reporter, this part
does indeed work as specified.
