# Part:BBa_K314100

Designed by: Tomas Huber, Justin Siegel   Group: iGEM10_Washington
(2010-10-08)

High constitutive expression cassette

High constitutive protein expression insert includes f1 origin
[K314110](http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K314110), a high expression promoter
[J23100](http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_J23100), and the Elowitz standard RBS
[B0034](http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_B0034). When ligated with a protein
coding sequence at the SpeI site the scar site created will create proper
spacing for protein expression.

### Usage and Biology

[![Washington2010 vector assay

| [BBa_E0040](http://parts.igem.org/wiki/index.php/Part:BBa_E0040) (GFP) was
inserted between S and P using standard BioBrick assembly. The resulting
constructs were grow in DH5a (constitutive promoters
[BBa_J23100](http://parts.igem.org/wiki/index.php/Part:BBa_J23100) or
[BBa_J23114](http://parts.igem.org/wiki/index.php/Part:BBa_J23114), as well as
inducible promoter
[BBa_R0011](http://parts.igem.org/wiki/index.php/Part:BBa_R0011)) or
BL21(DE3)* (T7 promoter,
[BBa_K314104](http://parts.igem.org/wiki/index.php/Part:BBa_K314104)) cells
overnight at 298K in either the presence or absence of 0.5mM IPTG. The cells
were harvested, washed in PBS, and then fluorescence for the whole cells was
measured on a fluorometer (ex. 485, em. 525) and normalized to cell density
(OD600). Cells that did not contain GFP were used as a blank. As observed, the
addition of IPTG significantly increased the observed fluorescence of the
cells.
