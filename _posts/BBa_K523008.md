# Part:BBa_K523008

INP for BioSandwich

This is a modified version of
[BBa_K265008](http://parts.igem.org/wiki/index.php/Part:BBa_K265008) for use
with the BioSandwich protocol (RFC 81) of Edinburgh 2011.

When used to make fusion proteins, BioSandwich assembly requires an in-frame
BglII site (formed by the last 2 bases of the RFC10 prefix and the first 4
bases at the start of this BioBrick) and an in-frame SpeI site (present in the
RFC10 suffix). Because the SpeI site is out of frame, two extra "G" bases have
been added at the end of the BioBrick. When combined with the T at the start
of the RFC10 suffix, they code for a glycine residue and correct the
frameshift.

Incidentally, although this part has been made in RFC10 format, the two extra
bases might help in some fusion applications using other protocols.

### Usage and Biology

The DNA is a codon-optimised version of the N and C terminal domains of
_Pseudomonas syringae_ Ice Nucleation Protein. It has been shown that, when
INPNC is fused to another protein (the "passenger"), it causes the passenger
to be displayed on the outer membrane of _E. coli_.
