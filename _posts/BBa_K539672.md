# Part:BBa_K539672

Designed by: Shu-Han Chang   Group: iGEM11_NCTU_Taiwan   (2011-09-27)

promoter (lacI regulated)+RBS+Alss with a RBS (B0032)+ilvC+a RBS (B0032)+ilvD

Built in Plac, three weak expressing RBSs, Alss, ilvC and ilvD
([Part:BBa_K539631](/Part:BBa_K539631 "Part:BBa K539631") with
[Part:BBa_K539641](/Part:BBa_K539641 "Part:BBa K539641")). It catalyze
pyruvate into 2-Ketoisovalerate in isobutanol biosynthesis pathway and could
be applied in your interest part.
