# Part:BBa_K331024

Designed by: Adam Smith   Group: iGEM10_Lethbridge   (2010-09-29)

  
RBS with N-terminal Oligo Arginine - ECFP Fusion

This part has a oligo arginine sequence fused to the N-terminus of an enhanced
cyan fluorescent protein. This will be a component of the proof-of-concept
part BBa_K331018 which will show localization of proteins into the interior of
a microcompartment formed by the assemly of lumazine synthase proteins.
