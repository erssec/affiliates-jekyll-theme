# Part:BBa_K539421

Designed by: Shu-Han Chang   Group: iGEM11_NCTU_Taiwan   (2011-09-27)

promoter (lacI regulated)+RNA thermometer

Built in Plac promoter([Part:BBa_R0010](/Part:BBa_R0010 "Part:BBa R0010")),
followed by 37’celcius regulator RBS([Part:BBa_K115002](/Part:BBa_K115002
"Part:BBa K115002")). It can be applied in your interest part which would be
induced over 37'celcius.

### Burden Imposed by this Part:

![](http://parts.igem.org/wiki/images/f/fa/T--Austin_Utexas--
no_burden_icon.png)

**Burden Value: -0.5 ± 2.8%**

Burden is the percent reduction in the growth rate of _E. coli_ cells
transformed with a plasmid containing this BioBrick (± values are 95%
confidence limits). This BioBrick did not exhibit a burden that was
significantly greater than zero (i.e., it appears to have little to no impact
on growth). Therefore, users can depend on this part to remain stable for many
bacterial cell divisions and in large culture volumes. Refer to any one of the
[BBa_K3174002](http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K3174002) \-
[BBa_K3174007](http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K3174007) pages for more
information on the methods, an explanation of the sources of burden, and other
conclusions from a large-scale measurement project conducted by the [2019
Austin_UTexas team](http://2019.igem.org/Team:Austin_UTexas).

This functional parameter was added by the [2020 Austin_UTexas
team.](http://2020.igem.org/Team:Austin_UTexas/Contribution)
