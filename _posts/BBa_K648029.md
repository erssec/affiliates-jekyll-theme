OR, operating region for Lambda switch

The operating region for the Lambda switch that represses C1 and Cro bind to.
This region contains promoters prm and pr facing in opposite directions. It
also contains operating regions Or3, Or2 and Or1. In the lysogenic state, the
C1 dimer is bound naturally bound to the Or1 repressing promotor pr and
production of cro. Once RecA cleaves enough C1 dimer the system switches to
the lytic state. The Cro produced at the pr promoter then binds to the Or3
site inhibiting the prm promoter. For a better description of the Lambda
system read the book "A genetic switch" by Mark Ptashne. We used Or in
creation of the lambda system, as part of our project to create a sensor for
DNA damage in bacteria due to radiation.

### Burden Imposed by this Part:

![](http://parts.igem.org/wiki/images/f/fa/T--Austin_Utexas--
no_burden_icon.png)

**Burden Value: -0.2 ± 4.4%**

Burden is the percent reduction in the growth rate of _E. coli_ cells
transformed with a plasmid containing this BioBrick (± values are 95%
confidence limits). This BioBrick did not exhibit a burden that was
significantly greater than zero (i.e., it appears to have little to no impact
on growth). Therefore, users can depend on this part to remain stable for many
bacterial cell divisions and in large culture volumes. Refer to any one of the
[BBa_K3174002](http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K3174002) \-
[BBa_K3174007](http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K3174007) pages for more
information on the methods, an explanation of the sources of burden, and other
conclusions from a large-scale measurement project conducted by the [2019
Austin_UTexas team](http://2019.igem.org/Team:Austin_UTexas).

This functional parameter was added by the [2020 Austin_UTexas
team.](http://2020.igem.org/Team:Austin_UTexas/Contribution)
