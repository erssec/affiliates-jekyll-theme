Sod Cu/Zn

# Part:BBa_K847004

Designed by: Rashmi Sharma, Vishesh Jain, Kendrick Wang   Group:
iGEM12_Stanford-Brown   (2012-08-09)

''Deinococcus radiodurans'' Superoxide dismutase, SodCu/Zn

_Deinococcus radiodurans_ is an extremely radiation-resistant bacterium: while
about 10 Gy (absorbed radiation dose, Gray) can kill most vertebrates, _D.
radiodurans_ can withstand up to 12,000 Gy. Current literature supports this
finding with _D. radiodurans’_ unique genetic makeup which allows it to better
handle radiation exposure. The two main effects of radiation exposure to
bacterial cells are DNA damage and the creation of toxic superoxide species
(Daly 2009). To take care of the pesky superoxides, superoxide dismutases are
expressed in high levels in _D. radiodurans_ (Slade and Miroslav 2011). These
enzymes break the reactive species down into harmless oxygen and hydrogen
peroxides. This dismutase uses copper and zinc as cofactors (Gao, Zhang, Song,
Chen, and Zhong 2009).

## RHIT 2019’s Characterisation

[![T--RHIT--RHIT Characterization1.png](/wiki/images/5/57/T--RHIT--
RHIT_Characterization1.png)](/File:T--RHIT--RHIT_Characterization1.png)

To characterize Part:BBa_K847004 based on its response to heavy metals, we
introduced an experimental group to a copper salt solution and incubated them
for 24 hours. After incubation, we spun the cells out of liquid culture,
washed them, then replated them at dilutions. After letting them grow for 24
hours, we counted the CFUs on the plate and compared them to negative control.
This simple, but effective test allowed us to see what affect the part had on
the survivability of cells.

Characterization of BBa_K847004, the protocol for which can be found in the
last page of the Protocol section in
the[RHIT|Experiment](https://2019.igem.org/Team:RHIT/experiments) It shows
that bacteria containing the SOD gene in this experiment have better
survivability against the reactive oxygen species produced by copper,
including a larger number of final CFUs, as well as survivability at higher
concentrations of copper total.
