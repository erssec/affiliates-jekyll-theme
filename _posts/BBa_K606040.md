# Part:BBa_K606040

Designed by: Axel S�guret   Group: iGEM11_Paris_Bettencourt   (2011-09-18)

Promoter Hyperspank B.subtilis & E.coli

Promoter hyper-spank is an IPTG inducible promoter that has been designed for
high expression in B.subtilis. Gene expression under the control of the
promoter hyper-spank can be induced by addition of Isopropyl
β-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG).

This promoter is flanked by two LacO sites. One downstream to make road block,
and one upstream to prevent the binding of the sigma subunit. This part is
similar but not exactly the same than the part
[K143055](http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K143055).

Note: Since there is not a sufficient expression of the LacI gene in subtilis,
we strongly recomand you to add a LacI expression cassette for subtilis, such
as the one we designed [K606010](http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K606010). This
is a strong expression casset, with which you expect a low response with IPTG
concentration, used for a better control of the level of expression of the
genes in B. subtilis. Otherwise, the promoter is going to act as a
constitutive one.

Please note that this promoter also works fine in E. coli, and can be use to
build more universal parts, compatible with both B. Subtilis and E. Coli
devices, since the promoter have approximtely the same behaviour in both.
