# Part:BBa_K510022

Designed by: David Caballero   Group: iGEM11_UPO-Sevilla   (2011-09-19)

attTn7

  
**Single-target transposition to the bacterial genomes** is dependent on the
presence of a conserved sequence, encompasing the 3' end of the glmS gene,
encoding glucosamine synthetase, and part the intergenic region immediately
downstream, designated the **attTn7 site** (from attachment site). Our
[Bioinformatic analysis](http://2011.igem.org/Team:UPO-
Sevilla/Foundational_Advances/MiniTn7/Bioinformatics/attTn7_Insertion_Site)
reveal that this region is highly conserved, and Tn7 transposition has been
demonstrated in over 20 bacterial species ([Craig,
1996](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8556868)). However, the lack of a
suitable target may be the limiting factor in some of the organisms in which
Tn7 transposition does not occur, including a variety of bacteria, but also
archea and eukaryotes. The possibility of inserting a functional attTn7 in the
genomes of these organisms may enable site-specific Tn7 transposition for at
least some of them, thus expanding the host range of this transposon and its
derived tools, such as the [miniTn7 BioBrick
toolkit](http://2011.igem.org/Team:UPO-
Sevilla/Foundational_Advances/MiniTn7/Overview)
([BBa_K510000](http://parts.igem.org/wiki/index.php?title=Part:BBa_K510000),
[BBa_K510012](http://parts.igem.org/wiki/index.php?title=Part:BBa_K510012)).

**Figure. The organization of attTn7** (from [Rupak et al,
2010](http://www.mobilednajournal.com/content/1/1/18)). A schematic of the
attTn7 at the C-terminus of the glmS gene with the TnsD binding site is shown.
The sequence of the E. coli GlmS protein, and the consensus attTn7 sequence
were derived as described in the text (note that the least conserved
nucleotides correspond to the third position of each codon).
