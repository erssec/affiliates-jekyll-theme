MarR(G95S) super-repressor

  
MarR(G95S) (multi antibiotic resistance repressor) is the native repressor of
the E coli Mar operon. The operon consist of two parts: the MarC and the
MarRAB which both is controlled by the operator MarO, which MarR represses.
The Mar operon has been shown to cause resistance including Tetracycline,
chloramphenicol, b-lactams, and quinolones [1].

MarR(G95S) is amplified from the E coli K-12 substrain MG1655 by nested-PCR
and point mutated in G95S with PCR to get higher repression[2].
