PchiP-lacZ

# Part:BBa_K564012

Designed by: Anna Lewinska   Group: iGEM11_DTU_Denmark   (2011-09-20)

promoter and RBS of E. coli chitoporin translationally fused with lacZ.

ChiP encodes enterobacterial chitoporin required for uptake of chitin-derived
oligosaccharides. This outer membrane porin is required for Salmonella and
E.coli growth on chitooligosaccharides as a sole source of both carbon and
nitrogen. It is only synthesized in the presence of these substrates. In
nature it is regulated by sRNAs.The 5' untranslated region and promoter of
this gene is fused with reporter gene lacZ and is donwlregulated by sRNA chiX
(also known as micM or sroB).

This was verified by Î²-gal assays as shown in the table below. The
measurements are in Miller Units
