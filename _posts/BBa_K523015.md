# Part:BBa_K523015

Designed by: Edinburgh 2008, 2011   Group: iGEM11_Edinburgh   (2011-09-12)

Plac + RBS + cenA (endoglucanase)

This is _C. fimi_ endoglucanase under the control of the Lac promoter. This
was made by Edinburgh 2008 but vector-swapped into pSB1C3 and entered into the
Registry by Edinburgh 2011.

## ECUST_China 2019 Charaterization

Team ECUST decided to further work with the part BBa_K523015, which consists
of Lac promoter RBS and endoglucanase from C. Fimi. We characterized the
enzyme activities of CenA within cells via CMC-Na and DNS assays, hoping to
obtain a enzyme activity curve of varies pH and temperatures. And here are the
experiments and results. All assays, including the standard curve were
performed for more than three times.

### Part 1: Preparations

1\. CMC-Na solution of different pH: CMC-Na was added into PBS buffer to reach
1% WV. Take 100 mL pH=6 CMC-Na solution as an example, firstly 1g CMC-Na was
added into approximately 90mL PBS buffer, and then pH was adjusted by
Potassium Phosphate and Potassium Phosphate monobasic to pH=6. After pH
adjustments, the final volume of the solution was metered to 100mL. Same thing
applied for pH=7 CMC-Na solution. 2\. DNS Solution(1L): We dissolved 10g
3,5-dinitrosalicylic acid into an appropriate amount of distilled water, then
slowly added 16g sodium hydroxide, and then gradually dissolved 300g potassium
and sodium tartrate, next, made the final volume up to 1 liter. We then
preserved this solution into a brown reagent bottle and placed it for a week,
precipitants should be filtered for future use.

### Part 2: Glucose-DNS Standard Curve

A standard curve of glucose was obtained ranging from 0.1 to 0.7 g/L. In order
to reveal the reaction DNS was added and absorbance at 540 nm was measured.
Finally, data was analyzed in a spreadsheet, plotted to obtain the equation (y
= 0.5792x + 0.0322) with a correlation factor equal to 0.9843.

### Part 3: CMC-Na Assay

The biobrick was transformed into E. coli strain BL21 (DE3) and positive
clones were selected by Cm antibiotics. Due to the characteristics of E.coli,
recombinant proteins are scarcely transported out of cells, so we decided to
measure the enzyme activity of lysed cells.

Positive clones were further inoculated overnight in 4 mL LB broth with proper
antibiotic (chloramphenicol-Cm) concentration. The next day, we transferred 1
mL culture to 100mL LB in a 37℃ shaker proper antibiotics added. For
approximately 3hrs, O.D. of cell growth was measured, until it reached 0.6, we
induced with IPTG of 0.1mM final concentration. After 4 hours, the whole
culture medium was spun down at 4000 rpm for 10 minutes at 4℃. After that, we
re-suspended the 100mL cell pellet with 10 ml PBS buffer. We then used
Sonication to lyse cells, finally another centrifugation of 1200rpm for 10
minutes at 4℃ to discarded all non-soluble parts of cells and supernatant was
collected as crude CenA solution.

The assays were incubated at 19 °C, 28°C, 37°C, 46°C and each for two
reactions of pH6 and pH7. Based on literature, In a microtube 18μL of 1% CMC-
Na was added, followed by 2μL crude CenA and the mix was incubated for 1 hour.
To stop and reveal the reaction 30 μL of DNS were added, after 1 hour of 99°C
incubation, absorbance at 540 nm was determined. For negative control, we
performed contrast reactions at the same time, but it was reacted at the
temperature below 4°C so that the enzyme activity was inhibited.

At last, activity was calculated dividing μM of substrate between time of
assay. Results are shown in the chart below and plotted as enzyme activity
curve. As seen in the graphic of temperature against activity, the enzyme
activity of pH6 is relatively higher than that of pH7, and higher temperature
seems to have positive influence on enzyme activity is 30 °C and 37°C can be
concluded as the optimal temperatures due to a higher activity but in table it
can be discerned that 30°C presented higher activity.

As seen in the graph of temperature and pH against activity, the enzyme
activity of pH6 is relatively lower than that of pH7, and higher temperature
seems to have positive influence on enzyme activity: 37°C can be concluded as
the optimal temperatures for our fermentation and cellulose decomposition
process due to it is also a relatively growth fitness temperature for E.coli.

### Burden Imposed by this Part:

![](http://parts.igem.org/wiki/images/f/fa/T--Austin_Utexas--
no_burden_icon.png)

**Burden Value: 5.1 ± 4.7%**

Burden is the percent reduction in the growth rate of _E. coli_ cells
transformed with a plasmid containing this BioBrick (± values are 95%
confidence limits). This BioBrick did not exhibit a burden that was
significantly greater than zero (i.e., it appears to have little to no impact
on growth). Therefore, users can depend on this part to remain stable for many
bacterial cell divisions and in large culture volumes. Refer to any one of the
[BBa_K3174002](http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K3174002) \-
[BBa_K3174007](http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K3174007) pages for more
information on the methods, an explanation of the sources of burden, and other
conclusions from a large-scale measurement project conducted by the [2019
Austin_UTexas team](http://2019.igem.org/Team:Austin_UTexas).

This functional parameter was added by the [2020 Austin_UTexas
team.](http://2020.igem.org/Team:Austin_UTexas/Contribution)
