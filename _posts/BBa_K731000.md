WT CysE

# Part:BBa_K731000

Designed by: Jason Fontana, Daniele Rossetto, Giacomo Giacomelli   Group:
iGEM12_TRENTO   (2012-07-26)

CysE (Serine Acetyltransferase)

CysE is an enzyme involved in cysteine biosynthesis, also known as SAT. It
catalyzes the acetylation of serine to give O-acetylserine, a precursor for
the biosynthesis of cysteine. Some O-acetylserine is also converted to
N-acetylserine, which in turn triggers the assimilation of sulfate through
specific genes.

This part has been successfully operated while controlled by araC-pBAD both in
pSB1C3 ([K731020](http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K731020)) and the low copy
vector pSB3C5, in which it was characterized.  
This part was cloned by the iGEM Trento 2012 team for the creation of an
aerobically engineered pathway for the removal of the black crust disfiguring
marble stones. Further information about this part and its characterization
can be found in the [iGEM Trento 2012 wiki](http://2012.igem.org/Team:UNITN-
Trento).

### Usage and Biology

In _Escherichia coli_ conversion of L-serine to L-cysteine is mediated by the
action of two enzymes: serine acetyltransferase [1] catalyses the activation
of L-serine by acetyl-CoA. Its product, 0-acetyl-L-serine (OAS), is then
subsequently converted to L-cysteine by 0-acetyl-L-serine(thio1)lyase.  
The synthesis of OAS-(thio1)-lyase and of the enzymes involved in sulphate
uptake and reduction is regulated by induction as well as by repression [2].
The expression of cysE (the SAT structural gene), on the other hand, is
constitutive whereas the catalytic activity of the gene product, SAT, is
sensitive to feedback inhibition by L-cysteine [3].

# Characterization by GZ_HFI 2020

  * **Group:** GZ_HFI 2020
  * Based on this part,we obtained cysE-Wildtype [Part:BBa_K3595004](/Part:BBa_K3595004 "Part:BBa K3595004") only containing the cysE coding sequence from _E.coli dh5a_ genome. In order to increase cysteine production, we constructed different cyse mutant genes. By placing these elements downstream of the PTac promoter, we successfully constructed pBR322-KanR-pTac-cysE and pBR322-KanR-pTac-cysE-mutant.
  * In addition, we also established a method for quantitative detection of cysteine, and have completed the functional test of wild-type cysE and different cysE-mutants;

## Experimental Setup

### Bacteria culture

  * Plasmid pBR322-KanR-pTac-cysE and pBR322-KanR-pTac-cysE-mutant was transfered into the _Nissle_ host cell,respestively. 
  * Single colonies were selected from the experimental LB-agar plate , then inoculated into test-tube tubes with 4000 μL LB liquid medium with 4uL kanamycin for overnight growth at 37 °C and 200 rpm.
  * Inoculating 15 uL of culture solution overnight into a 24-well plate containing 3 mL M9 medium for overnight growth at 37 °C and 200 rpm.The media contained 3 ul kanamycin and 1.5 uL 1M IPTG. At the same time, wild-type Nissle was inoculated as negative control, and M9 medium was used as blank control. 
  * Detecting cysteine concentration in culture medium.

### Detection

#### Determination of Calibration Line

  * Centrifuge tubes are added 0.1mM, 0.2mM, 0.4mM, 0.8mM, and 1mM to 1.5 ml standard samples of L-cysteine respectively with 0.1 ml acid ninhydrin reagent and 0.1 ml acetic acid, mixed thoroughly at room temperature. 
  * The centrifuge tubes are heated in the metal bath with 100 degrees Celsius for 10 minutes, and then rapidly cool in ice. 
  * Then 0.7 ml 95% ethanol is added in each centrifuge tubes and mixed thoroughly. A reagent blank without cysteine is prepared under the same condition. 
  * The pipette is used to shift 200 microliter solutions of each mixture to 96-well plates so that solution can be tested by infinite 200Pro spectrophotometer, with light absorption at 560 nm.

#### Cysteine analysis and quantification

  * 0.1 ml supernatant of each EcN solution is taken from Deep-well Multiwell Plate and added to 1.5 ml centrifuge tubes respectively. The same operation is repeated as testing standard samples, and then use spectrophotometer with light absorption at 560 nm to test the concentration of cysteine in the solutions.

## Results

  * All of our engineered bacteria have shown great improvement in the ability to produce cysteine, which represents that they can absorb H2S to a larger extent.
