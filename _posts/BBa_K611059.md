# Part:BBa_K611059

Designed by: Nicholas Csicsery   Group: iGEM11_UC_Davis   (2011-09-27)

  
pTet Promoter Variant #9 in Characterization Construct

This part contains a variant of the wild type Tet repressible promoter, and is
followed by the pTet characterization construct, K611013. This allows for
testing of this particular mutant promoter at various concentrations of
repressor. The mutated pTet promoter in this plasmid expresses GFP and is
followed by an arabinose inducible promoter, pBad, which expresses the TetR
repressor. Thus, a user can increase the concentration of repressor by
inducing pBad with arabinose. This plasmid is very useful for the further
characterization of K611049.
