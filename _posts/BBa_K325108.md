# Part:BBa_K325108

Designed by: Theo Sanderson and Paul Masset   Group: iGEM10_Cambridge
(2010-10-23)

EPIC Firefly Luciferase (under pBAD)  
 _P. Pyralis  
(E. coli optimised)_

  
This part is a translational unit for a mutant of the luciferase from the
North American firefly (P. pyralis). It is under the control of an Arabinose
induced promoter (pBAD). D-Luciferin has to be added to obtain light output.

EPIC stands for **Enhanced Photon Initiating Complex**. It is described in
[Fujii et al. 2007](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17540326) as having a
10 times higher substrate affinity and luminescence output compared to
wildtype.

The part is codon optimised for expression in _E.coli_.
