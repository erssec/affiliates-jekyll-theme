Tse2/Tsi2

# Part:BBa_K314202

Designed by: Matthew Coyne, Ingrid Swanson, Jesa Landis, Matthew Harger
Group: iGEM10_Washington   (2010-10-18)

Toxin+ Antitoxin-Tse2 + Tsi2

Tse2/Tsi2: toxin antitoxin locus. This differs from part
[K314200](http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K314200) (Tse2) and part
[K314201](http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K314201) (Tsi2) in that this is the
entire natural toxin/antitoxin locus from _P. aeruginosa_ and thus contains
both the ORF for Tse2 and the ORF for Tsi2, whereas the other two parts are
just the ORFs of either Tse2 or Tsi2 on their own. We separated them to allow
for individual regulation of each component separately. Use this part if you
want to induce their expression at the same time.  
[Tse2](http://parts.igem.org/wiki/index.php?title=Part:BBa_K314200): A toxic
protein originating from Pseudomonas aeruginosa that has been shown to arrest
growth in both prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells when expressed intracelluarly.
It is a substrate for the _Pseudomonas aeruginosa_ type 6 secretion system.  
[Tsi2](http://parts.igem.org/wiki/index.php?title=Part:BBa_K314201): Protein
originating from Pseudomonas aeruginosa that confers immunity to the toxic
protein Tse2. Tsi2 is not secreted through the Type 6 Secretion System.
