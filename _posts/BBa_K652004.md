# Part:BBa_K652004

Designed by: Darren Zhu   Group: iGEM11_Yale   (2011-08-26)

RBS-ZeAFP-Term

This part contains an RBS, the type III Zoarces elongatus antifreeze protein
(ZeAFP), followed by a terminator.

Note: Becuase this protein is so small (7kDa), expression may be difficult to
detect on a Tris-Glycine gel. Using a Tris-Tricine system where small proteins
are easier to see (not so diffuse) is advisable.

  
WPI-Worcester 2015 Characterization

As part of our antifreeze protein library, we characterized ZeAFP by measuring
both its freeze survival and biofilm activity, as well as creating the
BioBricks
BBa_K1809021[[1]](http://parts.igem.org/wiki/index.php?title=Part:BBa_K1809021)
and
BBa_K1809022[[2]](http://parts.igem.org/wiki/index.php?title=Part:BBa_K1809022).

To test freeze survival, a liquid culture of E. coli was grown up overnight
and three samples were taken. An MTS assay was performed for the first sample
to determine the amount of live E. coli present, while the other two samples
were placed in a slow-freeze box at -20C and -80C respectively. After 24 hours
MTS assays were then performed on these two samples to determine what
percentage of cells survived the freezing.

**Figure 1: Freeze survival for an empty vector control and ZeAFP at -20C and
-80C.**

We found no conclusive evidence for ZeAFP promoting freeze survival in _E.
coli_.

To test biofilm activity, each construct was transformed into the biofilm
forming strain EMG2:Kλ E. coli and the strain was grown on a 96 well plate.
Crystal violet was added to each well and washed, then acetic acid was used to
break down the remaining crystal violet so that biofilm formation could be
measured colorimetrically. These results were then normalized to an EMG2:Kλ
without plasmid control.

We found that ZeAFP significantly increased biofilm formation relative to our
control.

This graph shows the concentrations of purified proteins, including ZeAFP,
labeled as "Ze" on the graph.

These are graphs of biofilm assays that included the protein ZeAFP. The
proteins were either mixed into the bacteria or it was used to coat the plate
that the biofilm was going to be grown on.

This is a graph of the biofilm production with and without the expression of
different antifreeze proteins.The expression of these proteins was proven on
the following gel:
