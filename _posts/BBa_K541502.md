# Part:BBa_K541502

Designed by: Fazilet Guler   Group: iGEM11_FAGEM   (2011-07-19)

  
Promoter Pveg, RBS spoVG and LipA signal peptide for B. subtilis

Constitutive promoter veg(BBa_K143012) coupled to the strong Ribosome Binding
Site spoVG(BBa_K143021) from B. subtilis. These parts have been taken from
2008_Imperial_Collage. Pveg is a constitutive promoter that constitutively
expresses the P43 protein in B. subtilis. SpoVG is an endogenous ribosome
binding site from B. subtilis. The sequence of the spoVG ribosome binding site
is AAAGGUGGUGA which is complementary to the sequence UUUCCUCCACU from the 3'
region of the 16s rRNA from B. subtilis. LipA is a signal peptide from the B.
subtilis genome. In general, signal peptides are responsible for directing
preproteins (secretory proteins with a signal peptide region attached)through
an appropriate secretory pathway[3]. LipA has been successfully used in the
secretion of heterologous proteins such as cutinase by B. subtilis.

### Functional Parameters

  

## Functional Parameters: Austin_UTexas

### Burden Imposed by this Part:

![](http://parts.igem.org/wiki/images/7/7a/T--Austin_Utexas--
high_significant_burden.png)

**Burden Value: 24.6 ± 3.2%**

Burden is the percent reduction in the growth rate of _E. coli_ cells
transformed with a plasmid containing this BioBrick (± values are 95%
confidence limits). This part exhibited a significant burden. Users should be
aware that BioBricks with a burden of >20-30% may be susceptible to mutating
to become less functional or nonfunctional as an evolutionary consequence of
this fitness cost. This risk increases as they used for more bacterial cell
divisions or in larger cultures. Users should be especially careful when
combining multiple burdensome parts, as plasmids with a total burden of >40%
are expected to mutate so quickly that they become unclonable. Refer to any
one of the [BBa_K3174002](http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K3174002) \-
[BBa_K3174007](http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K3174007) pages for more
information on the methods and other conclusions from a large-scale
measurement project conducted by the [2019 Austin_UTexas
team.](https://2019.igem.org/Team:Austin_UTexas)

This functional parameter was added by the [2020 Austin_UTexas
team.](https://2020.igem.org/Team:Austin_UTexas/Contribution)
