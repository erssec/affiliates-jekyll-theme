# Part:BBa_K523001

Designed by: Mun Ching Lee, Sylvia Ispasanie, Allan Crossman   Group:
iGEM11_Edinburgh   (2011-07-19)

RBS + malS (E. coli periplasmic α-amylase)

_E. coli_ periplasmic α-amylase gene _malS_ (see [info from GenBank:
U00096.2](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/48994873?from=3735520&to=3737550&report=gbwithparts)).

The native ribosome binding site is present.

The part was made using the strategy outlined in
[BBa_K523000](http://parts.igem.org/wiki/index.php/Part:BBa_K523000), and
therefore contains 4 extra bases at the 5' end which generate a BglII
restriction site.

### Usage and Biology

While an amylase ought to be capable of degrading starch, the product protein
is believed to be periplasmic and thus ought to only degrade starch if it
leaks from the periplasm in significant quantities. Its natural function in
_E. coli_ presumably involves degrading shorter glucose chains: [Lengsfeld _et
al_ (2008)](http://dx.doi.org/10.1128/JB.00767-08) state that "MalS produces
preferentially maltohexaose from longer maltodextrins in the periplasm".

Other interesting and useful facts about the MalS protein can be found in
[Spiess _et al_ (1997)](http://dx.doi.org/10.1074/jbc.272.35.22125).

The SignalP program predicts that a 17 amino acid localisation signal (at the
N terminal) is cleaved off before the protein reaches its mature form.

Edinburgh 2011 carried out some experiments on this part under the control of
the lac promoter - see details at part
[BBa_K523006](http://parts.igem.org/wiki/index.php/Part:BBa_K523006).
