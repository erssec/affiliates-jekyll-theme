pBAD+TPP Down-regulated Hammerhead Ribozyme 2.5 with Native RBS+E0040+B0015

This is a basic part that consists of pBAD promoter, thiamine pyrophosphate
(TPP) ligand responsive hammerhead ribozyme numbered 2.5 with native RBS
(AAGGAGAT), BBa_E0040 and BBa_B0015.(fig.1)

**Figure 1** Construction of pBAD+TPP Down-regulated Hammerhead Ribozyme 2.5
with Native RBS+E0040+B0015. This part consists of pBAD promoter, TPP ribozyme
2.5 with native RBS (AAGGAGAT), BBa_E0040 and BBa_B0015.It is obtained by PCR
from inactive TPP-HHAz 2.5 [1] which is kindly provided by Markus Wieland _et
al._ , and then inserted into pSB1C3 through standard assembly.

This device can respond to different TPP concentration and inhibit gene
expression when induced by 1mM arabinose sensitively. The working curve is
shown in fig.2. The inhibition ratio is the value of fluorescence intensity
compared to that of without TPP.

**Figure 2** Working curve of BBa_K598011. The inhibition ratio is
fluorescence intensity under given TPP concentrations compared to that of
without TPP. Constructed plasmids were transformed into E. coli DH5acells and
characterized in M9 medium with a TPP concentration gradient of 0.001, 0.003,
0.01, 0.03, 0.1, 0.3, 1, 3 uM with being induced by 1mM arabinose.
