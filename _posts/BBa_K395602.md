MpAAT1

# Part:BBa_K395602

Designed by: Toshitaka Matsubara   Group: iGEM10_Tokyo_Tech   (2010-10-04)

Apple fragrance generator

BBa_K395602 produce MpAAT1 enzyme that catalyzes production of 2-methylbutyl
acetate and butyl acetate from 2-methylbutanol and butanol. 2-methylbutyl
acetate and butyl acetate has a apple fragrance.

  

We designed apple fragrance expression device with MpAAT1[1]. Fig. 1 shows the
outline of the device. MpAAT1 converts substrate and Acetyl CoA into apple
fragrance molecules. Acetyl CoA exists originally in E.coli cell. MpAAT1
converts 2-methyl butanol and butanol into 2-methylbutyl acetate and butyl
acetate respectively.

We performed gas chromatography to confirm the production of the esters, and
the results revealed that MpAAT1 successfully converted alcohol and Acetyl CoA
into our target esters (Fig. 2).

### Functional Parameters

  

  

## Functional Parameters: Austin_UTexas

### Burden Imposed by this Part:

![](http://parts.igem.org/wiki/images/7/7a/T--Austin_Utexas--
high_significant_burden.png)

**Burden Value: 20.3 ± 1.9%**

Burden is the percent reduction in the growth rate of _E. coli_ cells
transformed with a plasmid containing this BioBrick (± values are 95%
confidence limits). This part exhibited a significant burden. Users should be
aware that BioBricks with a burden of >20-30% may be susceptible to mutating
to become less functional or nonfunctional as an evolutionary consequence of
this fitness cost. This risk increases as they used for more bacterial cell
divisions or in larger cultures. Users should be especially careful when
combining multiple burdensome parts, as plasmids with a total burden of >40%
are expected to mutate so quickly that they become unclonable. Refer to any
one of the [BBa_K3174002](http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K3174002) \-
[BBa_K3174007](http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K3174007) pages for more
information on the methods and other conclusions from a large-scale
measurement project conducted by the [2019 Austin_UTexas
team.](https://2019.igem.org/Team:Austin_UTexas)

This functional parameter was added by the [2020 Austin_UTexas
team.](https://2020.igem.org/Team:Austin_UTexas/Contribution)
