raiI

# Part:BBa_K594007

Designed by: Yu Xiaoyan   Group: iGEM11_OUC   (2011-10-01)

  
a luxI homologous AHL synthetase from Rhzobium etli CFN 42

RaiI is responsible for the synthesis of 3-OH-C8-HSL, a kind of AHL. The rai
system in Rhzobium etli CFN42 can take the example of Rhizobium leguminosarum
bv. vicae. RaiI is positively autoregulated by RaiR and 3-OH-C8-HSL but is
also induced to a lesser extent by 3-OH-C14:1-HSL(produced by cinI) and
3-oxo-C8-HSL (produced by traI). These observations help explain the effect of
cinRI mutations on the production of some of the short-chain AHLs and also
suggest that an additional 3-oxo-C8-HSL-producing locus may contribute to
regulation of raiRI.
