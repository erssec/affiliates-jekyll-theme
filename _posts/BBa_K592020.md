# Part:BBa_K592020

Designed by: Lei Sun   Group: iGEM11_Uppsala-Sweden   (2011-09-21)

  
PFixK2-lambda C1-B0034-amilCP blue light sensor output

FixK2 promoter is the downstream signaling promoter of YF1/FixJ blue light-
sensing system. The YF1/FixJ system become "inactive" when illuminated by blue
light, and "active" in darkness. Needless to say, a system that works in the
opposite way with lights activating and darkness inactivating is more
desirable. Therefore, an inverter was placed behind FixK2 promoter. When in
dark, YF1 becomes phosphorylated and activates FixJ, its own RR. FixJ in turn
binds to FixK2 promoter, allowing the transcription of the lambda C1, thus
repressing the amilCP output. In light however, YF1/FixJ has no effect on
FixK2 promoter, which in turn has near-zero activity. The lambda C1
concentration drops, eventually amilCP will be produced.

## Functional Parameters: Austin_UTexas

### Burden Imposed by this Part:

![](http://parts.igem.org/wiki/images/7/7a/T--Austin_Utexas--
high_significant_burden.png)

**Burden Value: 31.8 ± 5.0%**

Burden is the percent reduction in the growth rate of _E. coli_ cells
transformed with a plasmid containing this BioBrick (± values are 95%
confidence limits). This part exhibited a significant burden. Users should be
aware that BioBricks with a burden of >20-30% may be susceptible to mutating
to become less functional or nonfunctional as an evolutionary consequence of
this fitness cost. This risk increases as they used for more bacterial cell
divisions or in larger cultures. Users should be especially careful when
combining multiple burdensome parts, as plasmids with a total burden of >40%
are expected to mutate so quickly that they become unclonable. Refer to any
one of the [BBa_K3174002](http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K3174002) \-
[BBa_K3174007](http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K3174007) pages for more
information on the methods and other conclusions from a large-scale
measurement project conducted by the [2019 Austin_UTexas
team.](https://2019.igem.org/Team:Austin_UTexas)

This functional parameter was added by the [2020 Austin_UTexas
team.](https://2020.igem.org/Team:Austin_UTexas/Contribution)
