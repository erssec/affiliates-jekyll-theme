# Part:BBa_K517002

Designed by: Joe Ho   Group: iGEM11_British_Columbia   (2011-09-21)

alpha-pinene synthase

The (-)-a-pinene synthase (PsTPS-Pin) synthase is a monoterpene synthase
isolated from Sitka spruce converts geranyl pyrophosphate to 83.4%(-)-alpha-
pinene, 12.6%(-)-beta-pinene, 2.1% Linalool, 1.0% (-)-beta-phellandrene, 0.4%
Camphene, and 0.4% myrcene. (-)-a-pinene synthase has been previously
characterized by expression in C41 DE3 E. coli followed by a His-tag
purification.

**Gas Chromatography Mass Spectrum of Alpha-pinene Synthase Products:** We
expressed the alpha-pinene synthase
([BBa_K517002](http://parts.igem.org/wiki/index.php/Part:BBa_K517002)) in C41
DE3 _E. coli_ and lysed the cell culture to obtain protein extract which was
run through a nickel column to purify the HIS-tagged alpha-pinene synthase.
The purified synthase was used in an _in vitro_ enzymatic assay to produce
alpha-pinene from geranyl diphosphate (GPP) substrate. (A) **Monoterpene
product spectrum of our alpha-pinene synthase.** Through gas chromatography
mass spectrometry, we analysed the products of the alpha-pinene synthase and
found alpha-pinene, beta-pinene and small quantities of other monoterpenes.
This product spectrum agrees with prior findings (Keeling et al. 2011 BMC
Plant Biology). (B) **Identification of alpha-pinene as a product.** Cross
referencing with standards and a compound library revealed that the alpha-
pinene product had the characteristic base peaks and retention time of 3.6
minutes. Top panel displays peak spectrum for our sample. Bottom panel
displays peak spectrum for library standard. (C) **Identification of beta-
pinene as a product.** Cross referencing with standards and a compound library
revealed that the beta-pinene product had the characteristic base peaks and
retention time of 5.6 minutes. Top panel displays peak spectrum for our
sample. Bottom panel displays peak spectrum for library standard.

### Burden Imposed by this Part:

no_burden_icon.png)

**Burden Value: 0.6 ± 4.4%**

Burden is the percent reduction in the growth rate of _E. coli_ cells
transformed with a plasmid containing this BioBrick (± values are 95%
confidence limits). This BioBrick did not exhibit a burden that was
significantly greater than zero (i.e., it appears to have little to no impact
on growth). Therefore, users can depend on this part to remain stable for many
bacterial cell divisions and in large culture volumes. Refer to any one of the
[BBa_K3174002](http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K3174002) \-
[BBa_K3174007](http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K3174007) pages for more
information on the methods, an explanation of the sources of burden, and other
conclusions from a large-scale measurement project conducted by the [2019
Austin_UTexas team](http://2019.igem.org/Team:Austin_UTexas).

This functional parameter was added by the [2020 Austin_UTexas
team.](http://2020.igem.org/Team:Austin_UTexas/Contribution)
