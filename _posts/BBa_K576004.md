# Part:BBa_K576004

Designed by: George Zarubin   Group: iGEM11_Waterloo   (2011-06-20)

  
Right Part of Self-Excising Ribozyme

Modified 3' "half" of intron found in ORF #142 in Twort phage of
Staphylococcus aureus in RFC53 MetaPart format. When complemented with 5'
"half" [BBa_K576003](http://parts.igem.org/wiki/index.php/Part:BBa_K576003) in
complience with BBFRFC53 assembly standard, the RNA-level excision should
leave GGU linker between the whatever comes before K576003 and after K576004.
K576003 and K576004 and everything in between them would be removed and
possibly circularized.
