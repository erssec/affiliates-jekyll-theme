pBAD-pXyl AND Gate  

pBAD-pXyl is a combined promoter of D-Xylose and L-arabinose sugar sensor
systems which is designed to be activated only in the presence of both sugars
in the medium therefore functioning as an AND logic gate.  

### BIOLOGY

  
pXyl is an inducible promoter regulated by the transcriptional regulator XylR
which, in Bacillus subtilis, regulates the expression of xyl operon[1]. Gene
expression under pXyl can be induced by the addition of D-Xylose to the medium
[1, 2]. The nucleotide sequence was obtained from Wilhelm, M &C. P.
Hollenberg, 1985[3].  
  

In the presence of L-arabinose, expression from pBAD is turned on while the
absence of L-arabinose produces very low levels of transcription from pBAD [4,
5]. More precisely, in the absence of arabinose, the repressor protein AraC
(BBa_I13458[6]) binds to the AraI1 operator site of pBAD and the upstream
operator site AraO2, blocking transcription[7], but in the presence of
arabinose, AraC binds to it and changes its conformation such that it
interacts with the AraI1 and AraI2 operator sites, permitting
transcription[7]. The nucleotide sequence was similar of that in
Part:BBa_K206000[8].  
  

For iGEM UNAM Genomics México 2012 project [9], pBAD/pXyl was used in the
design of an AND logic gate[10] using a recently described new type of
communication system between Bacillus Subtilis cells called Nanotubes[11].  
  
  

### Characterization

The characterization of this construction was made on an E.coli strain in a
semi quantitative attempt. In that way, we expected that only araC was
repressing the promoter because the xylR binding sites corresponds to xylR of
B. subtilis. Since it requires sugars for its expression, and the system is
repressed by a metabolite from the pentose metabolism pathway, we used a
minimal medium, M9 (Sambrook, 1989), but we changed the glucose for arginine
as carbon source in order to get the lowest interference in the expression of
GFP from another monosaccharides species in the medium. We use a gradient for
both, xylose and arabinose on cultures at 0.1 O.D (540 nm). We could see that
the expression of GFP increases as the amount of sugars added also increases.
An amount of 0.01% (g/ml) of arabinose is enough for an increase of 4 times
the basal expression, and the maximum production is approximately 5 times
greater for the downstream genes with 0.1%(g/ml) of arabinose. Xylose gradient
had a small contribution on the expression of GFP, which could be attributed
to the partial similarity of the binding sites between xylR from B. subtilis
and E. coli. The measurements were made with a filter fluorometer based in
three different measures for each condition.
