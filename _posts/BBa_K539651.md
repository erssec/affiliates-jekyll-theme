# Part:BBa_K539651

Designed by: Shu-Han Chang   Group: iGEM11_NCTU_Taiwan   (2011-09-27)

promoter (lacI regulated) + a RBS (B0032)+Alss with a RBS (B0030)+ilvC

Built in Plac, one weak expressing RBS, Alss
([Part:BBa_K539631](/Part:BBa_K539631 "Part:BBa K539631")),one strong RBS and
ilvC ([Part:BBa_K539621](/Part:BBa_K539621 "Part:BBa K539621")). It catalyze
pyruvate into 2,3-Dihydroxy-isovalerate in isobutanol biosynthesis pathway and
could be applied in your interest part.
