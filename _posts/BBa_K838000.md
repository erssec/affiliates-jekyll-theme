LovTAP-VP1

# Part:BBa_K838000

Designed by: Nicolas Gobet   Group: iGEM12_EPF-Lausanne   (2012-09-21)

Mammalian LovTAP-VP16

LovTAP-VP16 is a light-sensitive protein that binds to DNA. The protein is a
fusion between a Lov light activated domain, a TRP repressor, an NLS/ linker
domain and a VP16 activator domain. As it contains a VP16 activational domain,
it's able to act as a transcriptional activator when it is bound to a TRP
promoter site.

The lov domain clashes with the TRP repressor domain and prevents binding
before the protein is exposed to blue light. After light activation the Lov
domain goes through a comformational change and the TRP repressor domain of
the protein can bind DNA.

## Source

This part is an improvement of [part
BBa_K191006](http://parts.igem.org/wiki/index.php/Part:BBa_K191006) designed
by the 2009 EPF-Lausanne team (LovTAP, a light-sensitive repressor expressed
in bacteria).

  

### Usage and Biology

[![LovTAP-scheme2.jpg](/wiki/images/thumb/0/0c/LovTAP-scheme2.jpg/300px-
LovTAP-scheme2.jpg)](/File:LovTAP-scheme2.jpg)

When light hits the LovTAP protein, a conformational change happens and it can
bind to the Trp binding site. With our activator system, transcription of the
target gene is activated when cells are exposed to blue light.

### How do I implement this switch in my mammalian cells?

It's quite easy, all one needs to use this system is this part BBa K838000,
[BBa K838001](http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K838001) and some standard
mammalian expression vector to clone these two parts into.

**1) Cloning:**

First clone the part into a mammalian expression vector such as
[pcDNA3.1(+)](http://products.invitrogen.com/ivgn/product/V79020?ICID=search-
product) or [pCEP4](http://products.invitrogen.com/ivgn/product/V04450). These
are the two main expression vectors we used. **Note:** For the readout
constructs it is highly recommended to cut out the CMV or other constitutive
promoter from the mammalian vector.

Any promoters already present must be removed since we want only want
expression drive by LovTAP-VP16 and not constitutive expression. The part must
have a polyA tail at the end as well.

**2) Transfection** Co-transfect the combination of LovTAP-Vp16 and readout in
mammalian cells.

**3) Illumination** Continuous illumination with blue light (468 nm) is
recommended for the LovTAP protein. To build a set up like the one we used,
take a look at our [Bioreactor assembly page](http://2012.igem.org/Team:EPF-
Lausanne/Bioreactor), where we explain what components you need, how to
assemble them and how to program your illumination device.

  
**4) Test the expression** The best way to check the presence of LovTAP-VP16
in the cells is to perform a Western Blot using an anti-VP16 antibody and a
GAL4-VP16 positive control. It is also possible to exploit the
autofluorescence of the Lov2 domain, a feature permitting to detect an
emission wave length of 500nm when the domain is excited at 380nm or 490nm.
Flow cytometry is a good technique for this. Microscopy can be used to see if
the protein is imported in the nucleus. Look at the Experience page and our
[wiki](http://2012.igem.org/Team:EPF-Lausanne) for more infos!
