This matrix porin forms cell pores facilitating passive diffusion of small
molecules across the outer cell membrane. [1]

It forms a mixed heterotrimer with osmoporin OmpC which acts as the outer
membrane receptor for the CdiA-EC536 toxin, via polymorphisms in OmpC's
extracellular loops 4 and 5 [2]. It also acts as a receptor for the
bacteriophage T2 and is the probable major receptor for colicin E5.

Its native promoter is regulated by the dual transcriptional regulator OmpR,
which activates it under low osmolarity but represses it under high osmolarity
[3].
