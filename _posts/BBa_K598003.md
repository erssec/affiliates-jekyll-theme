TPP Down-regulated Hammerhead Ribozyme 2.5 with Native RBS

It's a basic part including only a TPP ligand responsive ribozyme numbered
2.5, with the native RBS （AAGGAGAT） This part is a thiamine pyrophosphate
(TPP) ligand responsive ribozyme numbered 2.5 with native RBS (AAGGAGAT),
which can inhibit gene expression responding to TPP. Although there are
standard restriction sites in this part, attaching upstream of target gene can
only be operated by site-directed mutation. Because the spacing between RBS
and start code of target gene after standard assembly is not appropriate.

This part is obtained by PCR from inactive TPP-HHAZ 2.5 [1]which is kindly
provided by Markus Wieland et. al., and then inserted into pSB1C3 through
standard assembly.
