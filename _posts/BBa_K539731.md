Designed by: Yang, Yi-Pei   Group: iGEM11_NCTU_Taiwan   (2011-09-24)

kivd (alpha-ketoisovalerate decarboxylase) under TetR repressible promoter

This is the coding sequence of kivd from Lactococcus lactis subsp. It encodes
alpha-ketoisovalerate decarboxylase which is responsible for the
decarboxylation into aldehydes of Î±-keto acids derived from amino acid
transamination. _Kivd_ play a vital rule in the isobutanol biosynthesis
pathway. This part, _kivd_ is under TetR repressible promoter that
constitutively ON and repressed by TetR.
