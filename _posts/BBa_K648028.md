Cro, Lamda Repressor which activates the lytic cycle

Cro is produced by the pr promoter in the lambda phage system. Normally C1 is
repressing the pr promoter. However, when the lytic switch is thrown and RecA
cleaves the C1 dimer the pr promoter is unrepressed. This results in the
production of cro which in turn represses the prm promoter which halts the
transcription of C1 repressor. In our project we used Cro to assemble our
lambda system.
