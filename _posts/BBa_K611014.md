# Part:BBa_K611014

Designed by: Nicholas Csicsery   Group: iGEM11_UC_Davis   (2011-09-18)

cI Repressible Promoter Characterization Construct

This part is used to characterize mutants of BBa_R0051 (c1 repressible
promoter). A mutant of BBa_R0051 can be ligated before this part (on the 5'
end) by cutting this plasmid at EcoRI and XbaI and the mutant promoter at
EcoRI and SpeI. Several of the mutant's properties can then be measured
through the expression of GFP. Certain characteristics of the mutant, such as
the binding of the c1 repressor, can be measured after inducing the pBad
promoter with arabinose. Concentration of the repressor can be varied through
different arabinose concentrations as long as AraC is present.
