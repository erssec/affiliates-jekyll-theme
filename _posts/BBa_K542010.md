# Part:BBa_K542010

Designed by: Anthony Vuong   Group: iGEM11_Lethbridge   (2011-09-26)

Enhanced Lumazine Synthase (ELS)

Lumazine synthase (LS) from _Aquifex aeolicus_ forms icosahedral
microcompartment (MC) assemblies of 60 or 180 monomeric units that self
assemble and are capable of isolating proteins from their local environment.
As shown in previously published work (1), the LS protein has been mutated so
that the interior of the MC is negatively charged; the UL 2009 iGEM team has
submitted the mutated LS gene to the parts registry (BBa_K249002). A
negatively charged interior allows for preferential compartmentalization of
positively charged molecules, which can easily be engineered through the
addition of a poly-arginine tag to a target protein (1). The size of the
cavity of the Lumazine Synthase microcompartment was enlarged and the negative
charge was increased via directed evolution (2). The compartment formed by
this polypeptide has a larger cavity and a larger net negative charge, thus
allowing a larger loading capacity into the cavity of the compartment.  
  
The part was synthesized by Bio Basic Inc. into the pET28a plasmid vector
(which allows for expression of ELS with an N-terminal His-tag). The Enhanced
Lumazine Synthase (ELS) was moved into the pSB1C3 vector by the Lethbridge
2011 team.
