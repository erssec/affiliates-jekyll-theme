# Part:BBa_K817016

Designed by: Shan Chi Hsieh   Group: iGEM12_NTU-Taida   (2012-09-18)

  
parS site

It is the centromere site that can be recognized by parB of pseudomonas putida
KT2440, when providing this part in cis on an low copy plasmid and providing
parAB cassette in cis or in trans, the plasmid can be active partitioned thus
it can enhances plasmid segregation stability and reduces plasmid loss rate.
