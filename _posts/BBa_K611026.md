# Part:BBa_K611026

Designed by: Nicholas Csicsery   Group: iGEM11_UC_Davis   (2011-09-19)

LacI Promoter Variant #6

Parts K611021 through K611027 are variants of the wild type LacI repressible
promoter, BBa_R0010. These parts were generated through three rounds of
mutagenic PCR and each have around 1 to 7 mutations. Each of these variants
differ in properties such as transcriptional strength and repressor binding
affinity and have been well characterized. This can be very useful in tuning
genetic circuits for specific outputs. These parts were characterized using
K611013. The data below was collected in strain BW22826 which is, among other
things, ΔAraBAD and ΔLacI. For more detailed information on this strain, it
can be found here: <http://cgsc.biology.yale.edu/Strain.php?ID=92290>

When induced with arabinose(as seen on the lower left axis), pBAD is
derepressed allowing for transcription of the Lac repressor. This is seen as a
decrease in the reporter, GFP (on the left, vertical axis). If IPTG is
added(as seen on the right axis), it binds the Lac repressor which frees the
promoter to transcribe.

### Burden Imposed by this Part:

![](http://parts.igem.org/wiki/images/f/fa/T--Austin_Utexas--
no_burden_icon.png)

**Burden Value: 1.8 ± 4.6%**

Burden is the percent reduction in the growth rate of _E. coli_ cells
transformed with a plasmid containing this BioBrick (± values are 95%
confidence limits). This BioBrick did not exhibit a burden that was
significantly greater than zero (i.e., it appears to have little to no impact
on growth). Therefore, users can depend on this part to remain stable for many
bacterial cell divisions and in large culture volumes. Refer to any one of the
[BBa_K3174002](http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K3174002) \-
[BBa_K3174007](http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K3174007) pages for more
information on the methods, an explanation of the sources of burden, and other
conclusions from a large-scale measurement project conducted by the [2019
Austin_UTexas team](http://2019.igem.org/Team:Austin_UTexas).

This functional parameter was added by the [2020 Austin_UTexas
team.](http://2020.igem.org/Team:Austin_UTexas/Contribution)
