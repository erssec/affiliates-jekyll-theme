RrD_C70K-PSB1C3-High constitutive

This part consists of [Acyl-ACP
Reductase](http://parts.igem.org/wiki/index.php?title=Part:BBa_K590032),
ribosomal binding site, [mutant Aldehyde
Decarbonylase](http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K590039) under the control of
high consititutive promoter for alkane production.

### Usage and Biology

When wild type Aldehyde Decarbonylase is co-expressed with Acyl-ACP Reductase,
odd chain length alkanes is produced from the cell's fatty acid biosynthetic
pathway. Alkane production is enhanced when growing expression strains using
the growth conditions developed by the 2011 University of Washington iGEM
Team. When mutant ADC and AAR are co-expressed, alkane production profile
varies. For more information, refer to the [2011 UW iGEM
wiki](http://2011.igem.org/Team:Washington).

Wild type ADC and AAR are co-expressed and GC-MS quantification of this co-
expression shows greater alkane production under optimized conditions.

Mutant ADCs are co-expressed with AARs under optimized conditions.
