# Part:BBa_K575033

Designed by: Kristin Palarz   Group: iGEM11_Northwestern   (2011-09-22)

This construct was developed by Northwestern's 2011 iGEM team as part of a
Pseudomonas Aeruginosa detector. The device is designed to fluoresce with GFP
in the presence of PAI2 (C4-HSL), one of the Pseudomonas quorum sensing
molecules. The promoter in front of GFP is activated by the combination of
PAI2 from the environment and the RhlR receptor (produced by this construct).
As the graph shows, addition of the autoinducer produces a significant
difference in fluorescence compared to the controls. Thus, our construct is
successful both in production of RhlR and transcription of GFP in the presence
of PAI2.

RhlR/PAI2 Inducible Promoter + RBS (B0030) + GFP + Constitutive Promoter + RBS
(B0034) + RhlR

Continuous expression of RhlR (with RBS B0034), coupled with a RhlR/PAI2
(C4-HSL) inducible promoter, RBS (Part B0030), and a GFP reporter.
