# Part:BBa_K523002

Designed by: Sylvia Ispasanie, Mun Ching Lee   Group: iGEM11_Edinburgh
(2011-07-19)

RBS + bglX (E. coli perisplasmic β-glucosidase)

This is the _E. coli_ β-glucosidase gene _bglX_. The part contains the native
Ribosome Binding Site.

The part was made using the strategy outlined in
[BBa_K523000](http://parts.igem.org/wiki/index.php/Part:BBa_K523000), and
therefore contains 4 extra bases at the 5' end which generate a BglII
restriction site.

### Usage and Biology

The product protein is believed to be periplasmic. β-glucosidase cleaves
β(1->4) bonds, i.e. those found in the disaccharide cellobiose.

The SignalP program predicts that a 20 amino acid localisation signal (at the
N terminal) is cleaved off before the protein reaches its mature form.

Edinburgh 2011 carried out some experiments on this part under the control of
the lac promoter - see details at part
[BBa_K523014](http://parts.igem.org/wiki/index.php/Part:BBa_K523014).

### Burden Imposed by this Part:

no_burden_icon.png)

**Burden Value: 2.0 ± 3.8%**

Burden is the percent reduction in the growth rate of _E. coli_ cells
transformed with a plasmid containing this BioBrick (± values are 95%
confidence limits). This BioBrick did not exhibit a burden that was
significantly greater than zero (i.e., it appears to have little to no impact
on growth). Therefore, users can depend on this part to remain stable for many
bacterial cell divisions and in large culture volumes. Refer to any one of the
[BBa_K3174002](http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K3174002) \-
[BBa_K3174007](http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K3174007) pages for more
information on the methods, an explanation of the sources of burden, and other
conclusions from a large-scale measurement project conducted by the [2019
Austin_UTexas team](http://2019.igem.org/Team:Austin_UTexas).

This functional parameter was added by the [2020 Austin_UTexas
team.](http://2020.igem.org/Team:Austin_UTexas/Contribution)
