**Figure 1** Construction of TPP UP-regulated Hammerhead Ribozyme 1.20 with
Native RBS+E0040+B0015. This part consists of TPP ribozyme 1.20 with native
RBS (AAGGAGAT), BBa_E0040 and BBa_B0015.It is obtained by PCR from TPP-HHAz
1.20 [1] which is kindly provided by Markus Wieland _et al._ , and then
inserted into pSB1C3 through standard assembly.
