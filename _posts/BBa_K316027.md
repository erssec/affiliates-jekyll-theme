### _B. subtilis transformation vector with LacI, targets amyE locus.

_

This vector has been designed using the amyE 5' and 3' integration sequences
for integration into B.subtilis genome

  
**AmyE locus** This vector has been designed using the amyE 5'
[BBa_K143008](http://parts.igem.org/wiki/index.php/Part:BBa_K143008
"BBa_K143008") and 3'
[BBa_K143009](http://parts.igem.org/wiki/index.php/Part:BBa_K143009
"BBa_K143009") integration sequences for integration into _B. subtilis_
genome. Insertion into the amyE locus provides a selection marker as the
bacterium will no longer be able to breakdown starch. An iodine assay can be
used to confirm integration. This phenotype makes the transformed bacterium
considerably less likely to survive in natural environments.

  
**LacI** With constitutivly expressed LacI
[BBa_K143033](http://parts.igem.org/wiki/index.php/Part:BBa_K143033
"BBa_K143033") the vector is suitable for B. subtilis transformations with
promoter hyper-spank
[BBa_K143015](http://parts.igem.org/wiki/index.php/Part:BBa_K143015
"BBa_K143015") or other LacI regulated gene-circuits.

  
**Chloramphenicol Resistance** This vector also contains a positive selection
marker. Chloramphenicol acetyltransferase
[BBa_J31005](http://parts.igem.org/wiki/index.php/Part:BBa_J31005
"BBa_J31005") provides resistance to chloramphenicol antibiotic.

  
**Blunt end cloning site** PmeI restriction site
[BBa_K316013](http://parts.igem.org/wiki/index.php/Part:BBa_K316013
"BBa_K316013") is designed as a blunt ended DNA (eg. PCR product) insertion
site. Due to the 8bp recognition sequence it is a rare site that can be used
to cut the vector only once. To add any BioBrick construct to the vector for
integration, it may be linearised by PCR (or by cutting with NotI if further
cloning steps are not required) and ligated into the vector after it is cut
with PmeI.
