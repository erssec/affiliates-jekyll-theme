# Part:BBa_K590030

Designed by: Matthew Harger, Lei Zheng   Group: iGEM11_Washington
(2011-09-15)

DrR-FabH2-PSB1C3-High constitutive

This part consists of [Aldehyde
Decarbonylase](http://parts.igem.org/wiki/index.php?title=Part:BBa_K590031),
from _Synechococcus elongatus_ , ribosomal binding site, [Acyl-ACP
Reductase](http://parts.igem.org/wiki/index.php?title=Part:BBa_K590032), and
[FabH2](http://parts.igem.org/wiki/index.php?title=Part:BBa_K590034) in PSB1C3
high consititutive vector for even chain length alkaneproduction. This
construct is designed to produce branched odd chain alkanes. Use of this part
results in low alkane yields ( 10mg/L), and results in slow cell growth. FabH2
should be used on a low copy number inducible vector. For more information,
refer to [2011 University of Washington iGEM Team's
wiki](http://2011.igem.org/Team:Washington/Alkanes/Future/FabH2).

[FabH2](http://parts.igem.org/wiki/index.php?title=Part:BBa_K590030)

This part fails, likely due to toxicity of FabH2. By lowering expression
levels and inducing FabH2 production in [the
FabBrick](http://parts.igem.org/wiki/index.php?title=Part:BBa_K590064), we
were able to produce even chain length alkanes. Sequence and Features
