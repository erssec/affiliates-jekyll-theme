sinI

# Part:BBa_K594001

Designed by: Yu Xiaoyan   Group: iGEM11_OUC   (2011-09-30)

  
a luxI homologous AHL synthetase from Sinorhizobium meliloti 1021

The Sinorhizobium meliloti strain Rm1021 harbors at least two quorum-sensing
systems; one of them is sinR/sinI system, The sinI is responsible for the
production of several novel AHLs, including C12-HSL, 3-Oxo-C14-HSL, C16:1-HSL,
3-Oxo-C16:1-HSL, C18-HSL, some of theses are the longest AHLs identified so
far. The sin system correlates with a delay in the appearance of nitrogen-
fixing nodules, as well as with an overall decrease in the number of pink
nodules, suggesting a role for quorum sensing in establishing a successful
symbiosis with Medicago sativa.

As a autoinducer synthatase, the use of sinI is the same with luxI, namely to
produce AHLS.
