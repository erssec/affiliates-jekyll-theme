# Part:BBa_K611018

Designed by: Timothy Fenton   Group: iGEM11_UC_Davis   (2011-09-21)

Mutant Regulatory protein/promoter characterization plasmid

This part can be used to characterize promoter/repressor and
promoter/activator pairs by swapping in the desired parts on either end.

To characterize promoter mutants, ligate the corresponding wild-type repressor
or activator on the 3' end by cutting the plasmid with SpeI and PstI and the
regulatory protein with XbaI and PstI in preparation for ligration. To add a
mutant promoter to the 5' end, cut the construct at EcoRI and XbaI and the
promoter at EcoRI and SpeI.

Repressor/activator mutants can also be characterized by simply putting a
wildtype promoter on the 5' end and adding the mutant repressor or activator
on the 3' end.

Expression is reported via GFP fluorescence. The amount of repressor/activator
can be controlled using the arabinose inducible pBAD promoter, with increased
levels of arabinose induction leading to higher repressor/activator
concentration and a corresponding change in promoter activity level.

Transcriptional termination takes place within the psb1C3 plasmid which means
it is not necessary to add a terminator once the wild-type and mutant
sequences have been ligated to either end.

This part was used to build parts like
[BBa_K611016](http://parts.igem.org/wiki/index.php/Part:BBa_K611016), which
allowed the characterization of the LacI promoter
([BBa_R0010](http://parts.igem.org/wiki/index.php/Part:BBa_R0010)) in response
to both IPTG induction and repressor concentration.
