PT5lac

# Part:BBa_K592008

Designed by: Erik Lundin   Group: iGEM11_Uppsala-Sweden   (2011-09-11)

T5-lac Promoter

T5-lac promoter is a hybrid promoter made from the phage T5 early promoter and
the lac-operon. It contains three LacI binding sites and remains repressed in
LacIq strains where LacI is expressed in high levels. It is inducible by IPTG,
and recognizable by _E coli_ RNA polymerase. Compared to the T7 promoters,
T5-lac promoter doesn't require the co-expression of phage polymerase.

### Usage and Biology

[![Promoter

**iGEM11_Uppsala-Sweden:** Promoter characterization. We characterised the
promotor in a TOP10 _E. coli_ strain together with PcpcG2
([BBa_K592003](http://parts.igem.org/wiki/index.php/Part:BBa_K592003)), PLlacO
([BBa_R0011](http://parts.igem.org/wiki/index.php/Part:BBa_R0011)),
[BBa_J23113](http://parts.igem.org/wiki/index.php/Part:BBa_J23113), PfixK
([BBa_K592006](http://parts.igem.org/wiki/index.php/Part:BBa_K592006)) and as
reference promoter we used
[BBa_J23101](http://parts.igem.org/wiki/index.php/Part:BBa_J23101). The
backbone pSB3K3, the RBS
[BBa_B0032](http://parts.igem.org/wiki/index.php/Part:BBa_B0032) and the
reporter BFP
([BBa_K592100](http://parts.igem.org/wiki/index.php/Part:BBa_K592100)) were
used in every construct, and we calculated the relative promoter units, RPU,
compared to J23101. The actual test was done in a slightly different way than
that presented at the parts.igem. Here we grew the cells in LB medium for 10
hours and we used flow cytometry to quantify the output. The flow cytometer
used was a BD FACSAria II, using a 407 nm violet laser and a DAPI filter (band
pass 450/40).

The results showed that PT5lac has a strength of 0.4 RPU in TOP10 when
repressed by LacI (not lacIq) and a strength of 0.6 RPU when induced with
IPTG.
