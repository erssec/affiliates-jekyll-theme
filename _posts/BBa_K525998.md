Designed by: Anna Drong   Group: iGEM11_Bielefeld-Germany   (2011-09-13)

Promoter T7 and RBS

T7 promoter and RBS. The T7 promoter does not work with the RNA polymerase
from _Escherichia coli_ but with the RNA polymerase from the T7 phage. To
express BioBricks under the control of a T7 promoter, _E. coli_ carrying a T7
polymerase gene have to be used (e.g. BL21(DE3) or KRX).

Used to express e.g.
[BBa_K525123](http://parts.igem.org/wiki/index.php/Part:BBa_K525123) \- look
there for typical induction profiles.

**Improvement of K525998 by ZJU-CHINA 2017 Teams**

The ZJU-CHINA 2017 Teams fulfilled the improvement of K525998 by inducing some
mutation in the sequence. A series of promoters with different expression
strength are constructed. The result can be seen by clicking the link below.

Author: TING-YU LIN  
Summary: We tried to improve this promoter sequence by adding a Lac operator
and making it [RFC 10](//tools.ietf.org/html/rfc10) compatible, since the Lac
operator from pET-29a(+) has an illegal XbaI restriction enzyme site . The
BBa_K525998 doesn't contain Lac operator sequence, and we managed to insert
one in it so it would work better with the presence of LacI protein, making
its regulation function better.

### Burden Imposed by this Part:

no_burden_icon.png)

**Burden Value: 0.2 ± 5.4%**

Burden is the percent reduction in the growth rate of _E. coli_ cells
transformed with a plasmid containing this BioBrick (± values are 95%
confidence limits). This BioBrick did not exhibit a burden that was
significantly greater than zero (i.e., it appears to have little to no impact
on growth). Therefore, users can depend on this part to remain stable for many
bacterial cell divisions and in large culture volumes. Refer to any one of the
[BBa_K3174002](http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K3174002) \-
[BBa_K3174007](http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K3174007) pages for more
information on the methods, an explanation of the sources of burden, and other
conclusions from a large-scale measurement project conducted by the [2019
Austin_UTexas team](http://2019.igem.org/Team:Austin_UTexas).

This functional parameter was added by the [2020 Austin_UTexas
team.](http://2020.igem.org/Team:Austin_UTexas/Contribution)
