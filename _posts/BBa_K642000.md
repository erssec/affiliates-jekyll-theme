TetR repressor tagged with yBFP

This is the repressor TetR from the Tn _10_ tetracycline (Tc) resistance
operon of _E.coli._ It will bind with high specificity to the _tetO_ operator
and is inhibited in the presence of ATc (1). This repressor is tagged with
yeast codon optimized BFP. BFP is a monomeric fluorescent protein that has an
excitation peak of 399 nm and an emission peak of 465 nm (2). It was yeast
codon optimized through DNA synthesis for the purpose of expressing in _S.
cerevisiae_ tagged to various repressors and activators.

### Fluorescence Data

We quantified the fluorescence of two tagged repressors: BBa_K642000 and
BBa_K642004 by cloning them downstream of the yeast Gal10/1 promoter. Each
construct was then integrated using KanMX6 selection into the Ade2 locus of a
BY4742 strain of _S.cerevisiae_. The resulting strain was innoculated in 3 mL
of 1x SM + 2% Galactose + 2% Adenine overnight. The overnight culture was
reinoculated into 1 mL of the same media at an OD600 of 0.02. After three
hours the strain was analyzed for BFP fluorescence on a Cyan ADP flow
cytometer.

with yeast codon optimized BFP and BBa_K642004, a TetR repressor tagged with
yeast codon optimized BFP and VP16 activation domain. These parts were
integrated using KanMX6 selection into a BY4742 strain of _S. cerevisiae_.
