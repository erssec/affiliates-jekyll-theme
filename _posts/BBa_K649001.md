# Part:BBa_K649001

Designed by: Tomoyuki Ohno   Group: iGEM11_Tokyo_Tech   (2011-09-26)

GFP regulated by 3OC12-HSL and LasR

Fluorescence intensity of BBa_K649001 was increased by 3OC12-HSL induction.
GFP expression after induction of 3OC12-HSL is 170 times as high as before.

Effect of 3OC12-HSL induction on fluorescence intensity  
This work is done by Takuya Tsubaki.

  
Generally, in the presence of 3OC12-HSL, LasR activates lasI promoter and the
transcription level of downstream gene increases, but in the absence of
3OC12-HSL, LasR can't activate lasI promoter. 2011 iGEM Tokyo-Tech
characterized BBa_K649000 by means of using BBa_K649001 composed of
BBa_K649000 and BBa_J54103.

  
We improved previous las promoters.
