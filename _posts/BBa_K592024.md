# Part:BBa_K592024

Designed by: Lei Sun   Group: iGEM11_Uppsala-Sweden   (2011-09-21)

  
B0034-BFP

Blue Fluorescent Protein
([BBa_K592100](http://parts.igem.org/wiki/index.php/Part:BBa_K592100)) with
B0034 RBS. One can add any promoter upstream of this gene.

  
  

### Contribution

**Group:** iGEM2016_Hong_Kong_HKUST  
**Author:** iGEM2016_Hong_Kong_HKUST  
  
**Summary:**  
We hypothesized that the expression level of mTagBFP is affected by the
presence or absence of a terminator. To check if that was true, we compared
fluorescence outputs from BFP generators with terminator, versus one without a
terminator.  
The results showed that the observed blue fluorescence outputs were lowered
when the transcription was not properly terminated.  
  
In this experiment, we have improved BBa_K592024 (BBa_B0034-BBa_K592100) by
adding a terminator BBa_B1006 3â€™ to this part in hoping to provide future
users with better reporters for their assays. We also would like to raise the
awareness on the standards of parts measurement through this investigation. We
cautioned on the direct use of previous measurement data for promoters
generated using BBa_K592024, and we suggest future iGEM teams that undertake
measurement experiments of any kind not to omit parts that might appear
irrelevant in the measurement cassettes.  
  
*Please refer to [BBa_K1899002](/Part:BBa_K1899002 "Part:BBa K1899002") as the improved part.
