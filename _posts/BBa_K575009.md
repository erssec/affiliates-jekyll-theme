# Part:BBa_K575009

Designed by: Kristin Palarz   Group: iGEM11_Northwestern   (2011-08-11)

LasR/PAI1 Inducible Promoter + RBS (B0034) + GFP

This part consists of the LasR/PAI1 (3-oxo-C12-HSL) inducible promoter, RBS
(Part B0034), and a GFP reporter. It is a characterized as a unit within part
[BBa_K575028](http://parts.igem.org/wiki/index.php?title=Part:BBa_K575028).

### Burden Imposed by this Part:

Low_significant_burden.png)

**Burden Value: 8.0 ± 4.3%**

Burden is the percent reduction in the growth rate of _E. coli_ cells
transformed with a plasmid containing this BioBrick (± values are 95%
confidence limits). This part exhibited a significant burden. Users should be
aware that BioBricks with a burden of >20-30% may be susceptible to mutating
to become less functional or nonfunctional as an evolutionary consequence of
this fitness cost. This risk increases as they used for more bacterial cell
divisions or in larger cultures. Users should be especially careful when
combining multiple burdensome parts, as plasmids with a total burden of >40%
are expected to mutate so quickly that they become unclonable. Refer to any
one of the [BBa_K3174002](http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K3174002) \-
[BBa_K3174007](http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K3174007) pages for more
information on the methods and other conclusions from a large-scale
measurement project conducted by the [2019 Austin_UTexas
team.](https://2019.igem.org/Team:Austin_UTexas)

This functional parameter was added by the [2020 Austin_UTexas
team.](https://2020.igem.org/Team:Austin_UTexas/Contribution)
