# Part:BBa_K577895

Designed by: Kyle Jones   Group: iGEM11_BU_Wellesley_Software   (2011-09-15)

  
TetR repressed RFP

A composite part containing the TetR gene, C0040, turned on by a constitutive
promoter, I14033. The TetR represses the pTet promoter in front of the RFP
gene. By addition of tetracycline or aTc, this repression is inhibited and the
cells should fluoresce red.

# Characterization by iGEM TU_Darmstadt 2019

When transforming _E. coli_ BL21 (DE3) using BBa_K577895 the transformed
culture expressed strong red color even without the addition of AHT. The
expression of the tetR repressor seems to be too weak to properly inhibit the
expression of the upstream following mRFP1 ( **Fig. 1** ).

** Figure 1: **BBa_K577895 transformed in _E. coli_ BL21 (DE3) without the
addition of anhydrotetracycline after cultivation overnight. The culture
expresses strong red color.

The expression of mRFP1 was measured using a SpectraMax M5E (Ex: 583 nm, Em:
607 nm) over a period of six hours with and without the addition of 200 µg/L
AHT. The results are shown in **Fig. 2**.

** Figure 2: **Expression of mRFP1 ( _E. coli_ BL21 DE3) with and without the
addition of anhydrotetracycline over a period of 6 hours. 0 h corresponds to
the time of induction with 200 µg/L AHT at an OD600 of 0.1.

The addition of 200 µg/L AHT does not seem to have an effect on the expression
of mRFP1. With and without the addition of AHT the expression of mRFP1
increases over the monitored time period.
