# Part:BBa_K542004

Designed by: Anthony Vuong   Group: iGEM11_Lethbridge   (2011-09-23)

pLacI Regulated Lumazine Synthase with Transciptional Terminator and pBAD

Made by assembling
[BBa_K542001](http://parts.igem.org/wiki/index.php?title=Part:BBa_K542001)
with
[BBa_K542003](http://parts.igem.org/wiki/index.php?title=Part:BBa_K542003).  
  
Note that the pLacI promoter
([BBa_R0010](http://parts.igem.org/wiki/index.php?title=Part:BBa_R0010)) is
regulating the Lumazine Synthase gene, not the pBAD promoter
([BBa_I13453](http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_I13453)) which is downstream.
Therefore, Lumazine Synthase production is IPTG inducible.  
The microcompartment portion to the "Co-localization Construct".
([BBa_K542008](http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K542008))  
  
This part was characterized in
[BBa_K542008](http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K542008) in _E. coli_ strain
DH5alpha to demonstrate its functionality as an intermediate in that
construct. The data sheet for BBa_K542008 is shown below.
