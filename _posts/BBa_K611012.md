# Part:BBa_K611012

Designed by: Nicholas Csicsery   Group: iGEM11_UC_Davis   (2011-09-18)

pTet Characterization Construct

This part is used to characterize mutants of BBa_R0040 (pTet). A mutant of
BBa_R0040 can be ligated before this part (on the 5' end) by cutting this
plasmid at EcoRI and XbaI and the mutant promoter at EcoRI and SpeI. Several
of the mutant's properties can then be measured through the expression of GFP.
Certain characteristics of the mutant, such as the binding of the TetR
repressor, can be measured after inducing the pBad promoter with arabinose.
Concentration of the repressor can be varied through different arabinose
concentrations as long as AraC is present.
