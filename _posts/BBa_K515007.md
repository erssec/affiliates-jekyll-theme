## Description

This part consists of the Dendra2 coding sequence codon optimised for
_Escherichia coli_. It is part of the composite BioBrick
[BBa_K515107](http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K515107). This sequence codes for
the photoconvertible protein Dendra2, capable of being irreversibly
photoconverted from excitation at 486nm and emission at 505nm wavelength to
558nm excitation and 575nm emission wavelength. Photoconversion can occur
using two wavelengths, 488 and 405nm[1].

### Burden Imposed by this Part:

no_burden_icon.png)

**Burden Value: 0.2 ± 5.3%**

Burden is the percent reduction in the growth rate of _E. coli_ cells
transformed with a plasmid containing this BioBrick (± values are 95%
confidence limits). This BioBrick did not exhibit a burden that was
significantly greater than zero (i.e., it appears to have little to no impact
on growth). Therefore, users can depend on this part to remain stable for many
bacterial cell divisions and in large culture volumes. Refer to any one of the
[BBa_K3174002](http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K3174002) \-
[BBa_K3174007](http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K3174007) pages for more
information on the methods, an explanation of the sources of burden, and other
conclusions from a large-scale measurement project conducted by the [2019
Austin_UTexas team](http://2019.igem.org/Team:Austin_UTexas).

This functional parameter was added by the [2020 Austin_UTexas
team.](http://2020.igem.org/Team:Austin_UTexas/Contribution)
