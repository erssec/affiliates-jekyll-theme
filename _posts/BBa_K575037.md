# Part:BBa_K575037

Designed by: Kristin Palarz   Group: iGEM11_Northwestern   (2011-09-22)

This construct is designed to report the presence of PAI2, part of the
_Pseudomonas_ quorum sensing hierarchy. When induced with PAI-2 (C4-HSL) at
varying concentrations, this construct fluoresced more than the control. Which
allows us to use this part as a biosensor for the detection of Pseudomonas
Aeruginosa. [![Rhlp-34-gfp

RhlR/PAI2 Inducible Promoter + RBS (B0034) + GFP + Constitutive Promoter + RBS
(B0034) + RhlR

Continuous expression of RhlR (with RBS B0034), coupled with a RhlR/PAI2
(C4-HSL) inducible promoter, RBS (Part B0034), and a GFP reporter.
