FixK2 promoter

FixK2 promoter is the wild-type promoter to which phospho-FixJ binds. FixJ in
turn can be regulated by YF1, the blue light-sensing protein. This promoter
shows very little leaky activity in the absence of FixJ.

### Characterization

From SoundBio iGem 2019

**Objective**

We wanted to test the reliability of this promoter -- is there leaky
expression? And if so, how much is there?

Leaky expression is when a promoter initiates transcription of a downstream
region of DNA when it’s not supposed to. In this case, FixK2 is only supposed
to initiate transcription when FixJ-p binds to it. So to test for leaky
expression, the genetic circuit shouldn’t contain FixJ. Thus, any expression
of the chosen marker is a result of leaky expression. In our experiments, we
used GFP as an indicator of FixK2’s activity. We designed a positive control
that constitutively expresses GFP and a negative control that doesn’t contain
GFP. Below are our genetic circuits:

1\. Experimental: FixK2, RBS, GFP, Double Terminator

2\. Positive Control: Constitutive promoter, RBS, GFP, Double Terminator

3\. Negative Control: FixK2

Because YF1/FixJ is sensitive to blue light, we also exposed our three genetic
constructs to blue light or dark conditions. Since our circuits do not contain
YF1/FixJ, we don’t expect the light condition to affect FixK2 promoter
activity. However, we chose to incorporate the light conditions to mimic
FixK2’s actual function.

**Methods**

After making 2mL overnight cultures of E. coli Top10 containing these genetic
constructs, we made a 1:100 backdilution into M9 media. We then exposed them
to their separate light conditions for 3 or 5 hours. From there, we extracted
150uL from each sample and put them into a 96-well microplate and analyzed its
fluorescence via flow cytometry (BD Accuri C6). FL1-A values were determined
by selecting FSC and SSC between the 25th and 75th percentiles.

**Conclusion**

Our results show that the FixK2 promoter has very little to no leaky
expression. In both light-exposure and no-light exposure tests, our
experimental plasmid had fluorescence levels comparable to the negative
control. Our positive control, as expected, produced significantly higher
fluorescence.
