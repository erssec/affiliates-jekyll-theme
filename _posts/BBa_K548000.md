Humanized Aequorin

This BioBrick is a human cell line optimized version of Aequorin, a
bioluminescent protein found in various jellyfish and other marine organisms.
Aequorin was discovered in Aequorea aequorea, a species of bioluminescent
jellyfish first purified in 1962 by Osamu Shimomura[1]. The protein requires
Ca2+ for catalytic activity and oxidizes its substrate, coelenterazine to emit
blue light (Î»max=469nm)[1]. Aequorin is NOT a fluorescent protein, it does not
require an excitation light source to emit light. Transfection of the gene
into 293T cells using lipofectamine has been confirmed. The part contains
EcoRI and PstI restrictions sites, and is ligated to the iGEM pSB1C3 backbone.
This backbone provides chloramphenicol resistance.

### Usage and Biology

This protein emitted light at the correct wavelength, and required calcium as
a cofactor, which allowed us to easily adapt it for use in our light activated
ion channel cell signaling system. In the presence of its substrate,
coelenterazine and the Ca2+ cofacter, Aequorin emits a rapid burst of blue
light.

### Characterization

We characterized our new biobrick with a series of experiments intended to
show two things:

1.Our newly synthesized gene could produce a measurable quantity of blue light

2.Our newly synthesized gene could only produce light in the presence of Ca2+

To do this, we transfected 293T cells with our gene contained in the pRRL
mammalian expression vector using lipofectamine (Aeq 293T), a common and well
characterized transfection reagent. After transfection, cells were lysed using
Promega Passive Lysis Buffer (PLB) and the lysate was mixed with either
nothing, only coelenterazine, only Ca2+, or both coelenterazine and Ca2+.
Then, samples were placed into a luminometer and the luminescence was
recorded. The results are summarized in the graph below.

Results of our luminometer experiments. Note that the y-axis is logarithmic.
As shown, Aequorin produces over 1000 times more light with Ca2+ than without
it.

As our luminometer experiments show, both Ca2+ and coelenterazine are required
for substantial production of light. In fact, when compared to Aequorin alone,
a mixture of Ca2+ and coelenterazine produced more than 10000 times more
light. Furthermore, note that a lack of Ca2+ reduced light output by 1000
times, when compared to the light output of Aequorin in the presence of Ca2+
and coelenterazine. Through this experiment, we have shown that not only can
our biobrick produce blue light, but that this production of light is heavily
Ca2+ dependent.
