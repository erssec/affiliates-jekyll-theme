# Part:BBa_K546003

Designed by: Brendan Ryback, Matthijn Hesselman   Group: iGEM11_Wageningen_UR
(2011-09-14)

Lux pL controlled LuxR + lux pR promoter.

This part was made as a replacement for a defective version of BBa_F2621.
After sequencing we noticed that BBa_F2621 was lacking the BBa_R0063 promoter.
We tested the expression levels of BBa_K546003 and BBa_F2621 using
RBS-J04031-B0015 as a reporter (See BBA_K546002). BBa_K546003 had a
significantly higher GFP signal than the F2621 BioBrick part we received, this
indicated that we fixed it.
