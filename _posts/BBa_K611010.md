# Part:BBa_K611010

Designed by: Nicholas Csicsery   Group: iGEM11_UC_Davis   (2011-09-18)

LacI Repressor Characterization Construct

This part is used to characterize mutants of BBa_C0012 (LacI). A mutant of
BBa_C0012 can be ligated onto the 3' end of the part by cutting this plasmid
at SpeI and PstI and by cutting the mutant repressor at XbaI and PstI. One can
then measure several of the mutant's properties through its regulation of GFP
expression. Concentration of the added LacI mutant can be varied through
different arabinose concentrations as long as AraC is present.
