Lov-tetR

# Part:BBa_K785000

Designed by: Zining Hou   Group: iGEM12_Fudan_Lux   (2012-09-21)

Lov-tetR (light sensor with Ptet repression) light->PtetO repressed

This part code a protein as a light sensor and repressor. With the existence
of this protein, expression downstream the PtetO promoter will be repressed
under the 450nm blue light. This protein, which is actually a well designed
fusion protein, includes two domains. The Lov domain is from Avena sativa
phototrophin1(AsLOV2). The tetR is from the tetracycline resistance, which
could combine the tetracycline and enable the expression of the tetA. We
carefully designed the linker between these two parts, and fulfilled our
sensor part in our biowave circuit.
