Red Firefly Luciferase and LRE  
 _L. Cruciata  
(E. coli optimised)_

This part is contains the coding sequence for a mutant light-emitting enzyme
(luciferase) and luciferin regenerating enzyme (LRE) from the Japanese
firefly, Luciola cruciata. It will make bacteria emit light at a reddish
wavelength when placed under a promoter, provided the media is supplemented
with luciferin.

The luciferin regenerating enzyme will convert oxyluciferin into CHBT. CHBT is
converted to more luciferin in the presence of D-cysteine.
