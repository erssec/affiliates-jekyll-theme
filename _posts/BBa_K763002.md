pNirB + Gene encoding ZsGreen1

This construction has two parts:

1\. The transcription factor-binding site inside the promoter and  
2\. the coding sequence, which contains a synthetic fluorescent (green)
protein. We chose as the promoter sequence the one of the nirB gene, because
it is 100% dependent on FNR [1,2], which is the transcription factor activated
when there is no oxygen in the environment. It is involved mainly in cellular
respiration and carbon metabolism during anaerobic cell growth.

When is the protein synthesized? In order to obtain this green fluorescent
protein one condition is required: anaerobic conditions should be met. We grew
the bacteria in a oxygen-controlled environment [3].

The molecular mechanism underlying this phenomenon is as follows: the promoter
is activated when there is a lack of O2 in the environment thanks to a family
of proteins called FNR. FNR proteins are global transcriptional regulators
that respond to fluctuations in ambient oxygen. They recognize DNA sequences
in inverted disposition with this sequence: TTGATN1N2N3N4ATCAA [4], where N1-4
represents a non-conserved tetrad (no influence). The FNR sensor domain
contains four cysteine residues that act like ligands for a group (cluster) of
4Fe-4S oxygen-sensitive structures. The acquisition of a 4Fe-4S cluster begins
heterodimer formation of FNR that bind to specific sites of DNA and regulate
transcription of target promoters. Under aerobic conditions (i.e. when oxygen
is present), 4Fe-4S clusters are disassembled and the FNR dimers dissociate
and form no structures that can bind to DNA.

How did we deal with this construction? Anaerobic conditions were achieved
after putting a culture of E. coli, stirring, inside a sealed box. We let the
bacteria to grow for at least two days and then we measured fluorescence.

### Characterization

  
In this experiment, our _E.coli_ strain carrying the ZsGreen1 protein under
the control of the nirB promoter was grown on LBA under two different
conditions: aerobic and anaerobic. Anaerobic conditions were achieved by
adding a small volume of sterile oil over the liquid culture (Figure 6), so no
oxygen can be taken from the environment. After 2 days of growth, samples were
taken from each culture and diluted to an OD of 0.1. After that, fluorescence
intensity was measured.

Our results show that ZsGreen1 expression increases (a 20% approx.) under
anaerobic conditions, according to the effect of oxygen on the FNR proteins
(see the [**molecular mechanism
description**](http://2012.igem.org/Team:Valencia_Biocampus/Molecular#OXYGEN-
REGULATED_PROMOTER)).
