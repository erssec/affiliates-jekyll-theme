# Part:BBa_K576003

Designed by: George Zarubin   Group: iGEM11_Waterloo   (2011-06-20)

Left Part of Self-Excising Ribozyme

Modified 5' "half" of intron found in ORF #142 in Twort phage of
Staphylococcus aureus in RFC53 MetaPart format. When complemented with 3'
"half" ([BBa_K576004](http://parts.igem.org/wiki/index.php/Part:BBa_K576004))
in complience with BBFRFC53 assembly standard, the RNA-level excision should
leave GGU linker between the whatever comes before K576003 and after K576004.
K576003 and K576004 and everything in between them would be removed and
possibly circularized.

### Burden Imposed by this Part:

no_burden_icon.png)

**Burden Value: -0.2 ± 10.3%**

Burden is the percent reduction in the growth rate of _E. coli_ cells
transformed with a plasmid containing this BioBrick (± values are 95%
confidence limits). This BioBrick did not exhibit a burden that was
significantly greater than zero (i.e., it appears to have little to no impact
on growth). Therefore, users can depend on this part to remain stable for many
bacterial cell divisions and in large culture volumes. Refer to any one of the
[BBa_K3174002](http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K3174002) \-
[BBa_K3174007](http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K3174007) pages for more
information on the methods, an explanation of the sources of burden, and other
conclusions from a large-scale measurement project conducted by the [2019
Austin_UTexas team](http://2019.igem.org/Team:Austin_UTexas).

This functional parameter was added by the [2020 Austin_UTexas
team.](http://2020.igem.org/Team:Austin_UTexas/Contribution)
