SpoVG Ribosome Binding Site (RBS) for B. subtilis

SpoVG Ribosome Binding Site (RBS) for B. subtilis.

This is a strong ribosome binding site from suibtilis. This part is a copy of
the part from Imperial college 2008, BBa_K143021, but we have synthetized it
de-novo, using primer matching technique, and submitted it to the registry.

This parts also works fine in E. coli.
