Designed by: Jarle Pahr   Group: iGEM12_NTNU_Trondheim   (2012-09-23)

lldPRD operon promoter + RBS from E. coli

This is the promoter region for the lldPRD operon (previously named lct) of E.
coli. The lldPRD operon encodes a lactate-dehydrogenase, and the lldPRD
promoter has been shown to be induced by L-lactate.

The promoter is repressed/activated by the regulatory protein lldR encoded by
the operon. In the absence of L-lactate, lldR binds to two operator sites O1
and O2 in the promoter region and inhibits expression. [1]

The activity of the promoter may be repressed by chloramphenicol and nutrient-
rich growth environment. [2]

### Improvement by NEU-CHINA-B iGEM 2018

## BBa_k2824006:T7-lldPRD operon promoter-GFP>/h2> <h2> Improve the
Characterization of BBa_k82000

In the following figure, we compared the expression of lldPRD operon promoter-
GFP and T7-lldPRD operon promoter-GFP. The T7 promoter could enhance gene
expression when the concentration of lactic acid was less than 1 m mol/L.
Considering that the lactate concentration in yogurt is generally no more than
1m mol/L, the conclusion can given that the T7 promoter can enhance the signal
intensity for our experiments (Figure 1). <p> Figure 1:lldPRD operon promoter-
GFP vs T7-lldPRD operon promoter-GFP

## BBa_k2824008:Lldr-T7-lldPRD operon promoter-GFP

## Improve the Characterization of BBa_k82000

<p> We can easily find that the Lldr-T7-lldPRD operon promoter-GFP part are in
a higher level of expression comparing to the lldPRD operon promoter-GFP when
the lactate concentration is lower than nearly 1.5 mM. Considering that the
lactate concentration in yogurt is generally no more than 1 mM, the conclusion
can give that the T7 promoter can enhance the signal intensity for our
experiments (Figure 2).
