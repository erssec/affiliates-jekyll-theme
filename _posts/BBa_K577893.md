# Part:BBa_K577893

Designed by: Kyle Jones   Group: iGEM11_BU_Wellesley_Software   (2011-09-15)

  
TetR repressed GFP

A composite part containing the TetR gene, C0040, turned on by a constitutive
promoter, I14033. The TetR represses the pTet promoter in front of the GFP
gene. By addition of tetracycline or aTc, this repression is inhibited and the
cells should fluoresce green.
