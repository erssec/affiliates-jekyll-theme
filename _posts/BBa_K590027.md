AAR1C3

# Part:BBa_K590027

Designed by: Lei Zheng   Group: iGEM11_Washington   (2011-09-15)

AAR-PSB1C3-High consititutive

This part consists of [Acyl-ACP
Reductase](http://parts.igem.org/wiki/index.php?title=Part:BBa_K590032) in
PSB1C3 high consititutive vector. This was an important negative control in
testing [the
PetroBrick](http://parts.igem.org/wiki/index.php?title=Part:BBa_K590025) \-
which consists of Acyl-ACP Reductase and another part from _Synechococcus
elongatus_ , [Aldehyde
Decarbonylase](http://parts.igem.org/wiki/index.php?title=Part:BBa_K590027).

  

### Usage and Biology

[![Fatty Acid
Biosynthesis.jpg](/wiki/images/thumb/8/8c/Fatty_Acid_Biosynthesis.jpg/300px-
Fatty_Acid_Biosynthesis.jpg)](/File:Fatty_Acid_Biosynthesis.jpg)

This part produces AAR, which catalyzes the firststep in the conversion of
cellular fatty acyl-ACPs to alkanes. AAR reduces the fatty acyl-ACP to an
aldehyde. To generate alkanes, this part is paired with ADC in [the
PetroBrick](http://parts.igem.org/wiki/index.php?title=Part:BBa_K590025).

[](/File:Washinton_AARADCGC-MS.png "Enlarge")

GC plot showing that alkanes are only produced when both ADC and AAR are
expressed. The red peak corresponds to AAR alone - which generates large
amounts of aldehyde, which are then reduced to the corresponding alcohol by
cellular alcohol dehydrogenases.
