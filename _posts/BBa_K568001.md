# Part:BBa_K568001

Designed by: Team TU Munich 2011   Group: iGEM11_TU_Munich   (2011-09-01)

Optogenetical AND-Gate red/blue light

This logical gate is based on amber stop-codon suppression via the non-
canonical tRNA supD ([BBa_K228001](http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K228001)).
The blue light sensor ([BBa_K238013](http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K238013))
induces the expression of a mRNA coding for a T7-polymerase with an amber
mutation ([BBa_K228000](http://parts.igem.org Part:BBa_K228000)), that can
only be translated by ribosomes if the correct supD tRNA is present. The supD
tRNA is expressed when the red light sensor
([BBa_K568000](http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K568000)) is induced. Thus, only
cells which receive both signals produce the desired substances. Cells need to
be transfected with another plasmid, containing a T7 promoter followed by a
reporter.

### Usage and Biology

If the part is hit by both far red light (705 nm) and blue light (465 nm)
beams, the AND-Gate is turned on. Red light induces the autophosphorylation at
the cytosolic site of cph8. This leads to phosphorylation of OmpR which
subsequently binds to OmpC promotor and enables transcription of the supD
t-RNA. Blue light leads to dimerisation of YcgF and binding of the repressor
YcgE. The formation of the YcgE-YcgF complex leads to the unbinding of YcgE
from the YcgZ promoter which activates the transcription of T7ptag (T7
polymerase with the amber stop codon mutation) if enough supD tRNA is
available.

This AND-gate should ensure that expression of T7 polymerase is only induced
when both wavelengths hit bacteria with the part.

### Experimental Testing

The part was tested using the following setup:

K568001 (in vector pSB1C3) and [Part:BBa_I746907](/Part:BBa_I746907 "Part:BBa
I746907") (as a GFP-based reporter, in vector pSB6A1) were electroporated into
_e. coli_ CP919. A clone from the transformation was picked and incubated over
night in LB (Amp, Cam) under red light (650 nm) to shut down the and-gate. The
next day, the culture was diluted with LB (Amp, Cam) to an initial OD600 of
approx. 0.2, and divided into three parts. These three groups were incubated
under three different lighting conditions:

  * in the dark
  * under red (705 nm) and blue (465 nm) light (using LEDs)
  * under the lamp of the incubator (white light).

The expression of GFP was measured using a GFP assay as follows: Over the next
6 hours, the OD600 and the GFP-fluorescence was measured (time between
measurements: 1 hour). 16 hours after the last measurement, the terminal OD600
and GFP-fluoresence were measured. Also, serveral measurements of LB-Medium as
blank were done. To get information about the "fluorescence per cell", the
following formula was used:

"Fluorescence per cell" = (fluorescence(sample) - fluorescence(blank)) /
(OD600(sample) - OD600 (blank))

Unfortunately the results we obtainend indicate that the AND Gate does not
work as expected. The reason can be the red light sensor which seems not to be
light sensitive. For further information see
