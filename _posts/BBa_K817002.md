PfadBA

  
It's a fatty acyl-CoA responsive promoter which will express the downstream
gene in the presence of fatty acid.

### Method

To evaluate the PfadBA promoter function, we design a PfadBA-mRFP reporter
construct. In experimental group we add oleic acid in media and compared to
control group, which is the same colony and identical amount of bacteria but
without addition of oleic acid. After 5 hr induction we measure the man
fluorescence intensity to get the expression level of PfadBA promoter in
either group.

However, the baseline expression of the reportor gene (mRFP) downstream of
PfadBA is so high that we cannot see significant signal rise after induction
of fatty acid (oleic acid). Therefore, we decide to lower the baseline
expression by overexpression of FadR, an endogenous repressor of PfadBA, whose
repressive function is antagonized by fatty acyl-CoA. [3] By co-transforming
constructs with PfadBA and FadR into the bacterial platform, it is made
capable of changing gene expression in response to environmental fatty acid
concentration.

### Protocol

  1. 10 μL bacterial culture was cultured in 5 mL LB at 37。C, with suitable concentration of antibiotics shaking for 18 hr.
  2. For experimental group, 480 μL of bacteria culture was transferred to 1.5 mL eppendorf tube and added with 20 μL of oleic acid and IGEPAL(detergent) in. For control group, 500 μL bacterial culture was added in 1.5 mL eppendorf tube.
  3. The tubes were incubated at 37℃ 5 hr for induction.
  4. 100 μL of bacterial culture was transferred tino 96-well plate. The mRFP fluorescence intensity was measured (Excitaion: 580 nm, Emmision: 610 nm).

### Data

**Oleic acid induction group shows higher expression of mRFP.**

### Conclusion

Our PfadBA promoter can work in response to environmental fatty acid change,
which acts as an important sensor for our bacterial device – secreting GLP-1
when host is fed with fatty diet.

### Characterization

[Team NTHU Taiwan](https://2019.igem.org/Team:NTHU_Taiwan) contributed to the
characterization of effects and inducing of fatty acid to E.coli and Relative

## Team NTHU Taiwan 2019: Characterization of effects and inducing of fatty
acid to E.coli and Relative Fluorescence to Anderson Promoter

### Purpose

From previous study, NTU-Taida found that pFadBA can be induce by adding fatty
acid. We’d like to understand more about this promoter by answering the
following questions:  

  * Does fatty acid affect the growth of cell?
  * Will higher fatty acid concentration induce more fluorescence?
  * How strong is the promoter pFadBA?

  

### Effect of Fatty acid to E. coli

We discuss the relationship between fatty acid and the growth of E. coli to
check suitable conditions for future experiments. First, we check whether
fatty acid affect our experiments. Second, we choose the best concentration
for future experiments.  
In general, relative cell concentration does not change very much. It
indicates that under 0.4mM and 3.125mM fatty acid, E. coli might grow better
than control. However, when the concentration is 25mM, it inhibits growth of
E. coli. We can notice that low concentration of fatty acid is somehow benefit
for cell growth. Therefore, we choose concentration lower than 10 mM as our
highest concentration to induce the promoter in the following experiments.

### Fatty Acid Inducing to E. coli

As our previous description, pFadBA can be induced by fatty acid because of
the repressor protein. We can obviously observe that with higher fatty acid
level, the fluorescence level will rise. The fold change is almost 2.5 times
in 0.625 mM LB, but is only 1.7 times in 0.156 mM LB. This data shows that
fatty acid actually induce the promoter, and higher concentration induces more
fluorescence.

concentration over time

### Relative Fluorescence to Anderson Promoter

To know the intensity level of pFadBA expression, we compare the intensity
between pFadBA and Anderson promoter. By comparing pFadBA with Anderson
promoter, it demonstrates that the fluorescence level of pFadBA is much lower
than the J023104 and approximately 10 percent level of J23110.
