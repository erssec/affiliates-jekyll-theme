# Part:BBa_K624001

Designed by: SHIH- HAO CHEN   Group: iGEM11_NYMU-Taiwan   (2011-09-30)

tetR+RBS+GFP+ter

This part is composed of _tetR_ and _gfp_.

These are the measurements of our construct tetR+RBS+GFP under fluorescence
microscope. The left graph is from the control group of _E. coli_ strain DH5a.
The middle is tetR+RBS+GFP in plasmid c3 in _E. coli_ , while the right is
from a plate without any bacilli. All graphs are measured in fixed exposure
time. Construct of tetR+RBS+GFP which emits light is thought to be a leak
phenomenon of plasmid, for RE digest has proven the sequence length is
correct, and further sequencing work is under operation.

  

  
**GFP measurements under different excitation wavelengths**

[![33.JPG](/wiki/images/f/fa/33.JPG)](/File:33.JPG)

  
The expression of GFP is measured precisely under excitation wavelength from
475nm to 501nm, given the absorption wavelength 511nm. In our measurement,
wavelength over 493nm yields high background, resulting in values of control
group surging far beyond normal condition. Thus, 493nm is suggested as the
best excitation wavelength, as it presents the highest emission light and the
lowest of the control group.
