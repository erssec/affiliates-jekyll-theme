# Part:BBa_K607035

Designed by: Christoph Wittich   Group: iGEM11_Groningen   (2011-09-20)

pUC18 replication origin

BBa_K607035 is a pUC18 origin of replication.

# Usage and Biology

BBa_I50032 yields vectors with an expected copy number of 30-40 per cell.

**Note:** This part did not have a reference sequence. A reference sequence
has since been added based on the part's documentation; a basic part
consisting of the origin of replication from the pUC18 vector (pMB1). The
sequence may contain additional bases not included in the function of the
origin. - iGEM HQ

### Burden Imposed by this Part:

![](http://parts.igem.org/wiki/images/f/fa/T--Austin_Utexas--
no_burden_icon.png)

**Burden Value: -2.9 ± 3.4%**

Burden is the percent reduction in the growth rate of _E. coli_ cells
transformed with a plasmid containing this BioBrick (± values are 95%
confidence limits). This BioBrick did not exhibit a burden that was
significantly greater than zero (i.e., it appears to have little to no impact
on growth). Therefore, users can depend on this part to remain stable for many
bacterial cell divisions and in large culture volumes. Refer to any one of the
[BBa_K3174002](http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K3174002) \-
[BBa_K3174007](http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K3174007) pages for more
information on the methods, an explanation of the sources of burden, and other
conclusions from a large-scale measurement project conducted by the [2019
Austin_UTexas team](http://2019.igem.org/Team:Austin_UTexas).

This functional parameter was added by the [2020 Austin_UTexas
team.](http://2020.igem.org/Team:Austin_UTexas/Contribution)
