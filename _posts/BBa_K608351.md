Composite

# Part:BBa_K608351

Designed by: Theodhor Tiko   Group: iGEM11_Freiburg   (2011-09-14)

(correct) temperature sensitive promoter

This is based on part ([BBa_K098995](http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K098995))

  

**Why did we make this part?** : Because sequencing of
([BBa_K098995](http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K098995)) revealed the lack of
nucleotides between the RBS and start codon of the temperature sensitive λ cI
repressor ([BBa_K098997](http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K098997)) CDS.

  

### Usage and Biology

This composite promoter consists of a constitutive promoter
([BBa_J23114](http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_J23114)), the temperature
sensitive λ cI repressor protein
([BBa_K098997](http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K098997)) _which has a cI857
mutation that results in denaturation of the repressor when the temperature is
raised to 42°C_ , and a cI regulated promoter based on the λ pR promoter
([BBa_R0051](http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_R0051)).

### Burden Imposed by this Part:

![](http://parts.igem.org/wiki/images/f/fa/T--Austin_Utexas--
no_burden_icon.png)

**Burden Value: 2.9 ± 3.8%**

Burden is the percent reduction in the growth rate of _E. coli_ cells
transformed with a plasmid containing this BioBrick (± values are 95%
confidence limits). This BioBrick did not exhibit a burden that was
significantly greater than zero (i.e., it appears to have little to no impact
on growth). Therefore, users can depend on this part to remain stable for many
bacterial cell divisions and in large culture volumes. Refer to any one of the
[BBa_K3174002](http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K3174002) \-
[BBa_K3174007](http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K3174007) pages for more
information on the methods, an explanation of the sources of burden, and other
conclusions from a large-scale measurement project conducted by the [2019
Austin_UTexas team](http://2019.igem.org/Team:Austin_UTexas).

This functional parameter was added by the [2020 Austin_UTexas
team.](http://2020.igem.org/Team:Austin_UTexas/Contribution)
