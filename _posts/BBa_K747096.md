# Part:BBa_K747096

Designed by: Lucas Schneider   Group: iGEM12_Freiburg   (2012-09-26)

CMV-promoter At first, we tried to use the CMV promotor that was included in
the 2012 distribution kit. [Part
BBa_J52034](http://parts.igem.org/wiki/index.php?title=Part:BBa_J52034) was
submitted to the registry by Team Slovenia in 2006 and has been on the
distribution kit since then (although sequencing was inconsistent every year).
After numerous attempts to use this part, we sequenced it and found out that
it was not a CMV promotor, but a part of the lacI gene. Reading the part’s
review, we noticed that Team Munich 2010 had already pointed out that it was a
lacI fragment. Interestingly, Team DTU Denmark was able to induce fluorescent
protein expression with this bacterial gene fragment- magic. Since no other
mammalian promoter was available on this year’s distribution kit, we designed
the following primers and amplified the CMV promoter from the vector pPhi-
Yellow-C:

GTTACCGGTCTCGTTAAGAATTCGCGGCCGCTTCTAGAGATAGTAATCAATTACGGGGTC
CTAGAGGTCTCGCTGCCTGCAGCGGCCGCTACTAGTAGATCTGACGGTTCACTAAAC

After incorporation of these primers into the CMV promoter, amplification
product, the promoter is not only flanked by the iGEM prefix and suffix, but
also by distal BsaI restriction sites. This way, we were able to directly
assemble the PCR product.

## Improvement by Calgary 2018

[Part BBa_K2605001](http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K2605001) is an improvement
of this part done by the 2018 iGEM Calgary team. A SalI restriction site
(sequence: GTCGAC) was added to the 5' end of the promoter, which allows for
the promoter to be used within the 2018 iGEM Calgary's Multiple-Cloning Site
flanked by FRT sites [Part
