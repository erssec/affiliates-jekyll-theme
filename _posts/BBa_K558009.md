ThiE

# Part:BBa_K558009

Designed by: Laura Colgin, Megan Tabor   Group: iGEM11_Nevada   (2011-09-23)

Thiamin monophosphate pyrophosphorylase

This is the coding sequence of thiamin monophosphate pyrophosphorylase (
_ThiE_ ) from the unicellular cyanobacterium _Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803_. It
encodes 2-[3-[(4-Amino-2-methyl-pyrimidin-5-yl)methyl]-4-methyl-thiazol-5-yl]
ethanol. By placing overexpression gene cassettes into the coding region of
_ThiE_ an auxotophic mutant that can only survive with thiamin (Vitamin B1)
supplementation can be created.
