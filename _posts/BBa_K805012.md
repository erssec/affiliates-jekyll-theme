Ruxyn

# Part:BBa_K805012

Designed by: Liu Ping   Group: iGEM12_HUST-China   (2012-09-20)

Ruxyn1 Glycosyl hydrolase (GH) family 43 b-Dxylosidase/a-L-arabinofuranosidase
Ruxyn can hydrolyze p-nitrophenyl-b-D-xylopyranoside (pNPX), p-nitrophenyla-L-
arabinofuranoside (pNPA), and xylo-oligosaccharide substrates. Ruxyn shows
high synergism with endoxylanase,greatly elevating the reducing sugars
released from brichwood xylans, and converted most intermediate xylo-
oligosaccharide hydrolysate into xylose.

  
We construct the gene on the carrier displaying on the surface of Pichia
pastoris and express it it in Pichia pastoris with electroporation. Then we
detect the expression on the surface of Pichia pastoris by observing with
fluorescent microscope and by flow cytometry analysis.

We fused FLAG-tag with N-terminal of Ruxyn gene on Ruxyn-pPIC9k vector. Label
cells with Rabbit Anti Flag-Tag Polyclonal antibody and Goat Anti Rabbit RPE
Polyclonal antibody. Result of flow cytometry analysis is as follows:
fluorescence intensity x-mean value of Pichia pastoris with pPIC9k empty
vector is 1.14, with Ruxyn-pPIC9k is 8.56.
