# Part:BBa_K524001

Designed by: HO Yuan Heng Trevor   Group: iGEM11_HKUST   (2011-09-28)

pLac + RBS + split sfGFP 1-10

The split sfGFP1-10 was constructed from an pBAD driven sfGFP
[BBa_I746908](http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_I746908). CDS of sfGFP includes
amino acid residues 1-214 of sfGFP. The amino acid residues 214 and 215 of
sfGFP have been reported to undergo spontaneous complementation to restore
green fluorescence. Hence when this biobrick is expressed together with
[BBa_K524002](http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K524002), which contains the the
remaining 215-238 amino acids of sfGFP (sfGFP11), the resulting proteins
should be able to complement and fluoresce.

### Usage and Biology

Induced by IPTG, the product of this biobrick should complement with the
product of IPTG inducible biobrick sfGFP11
[BBa_K524002](http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K524002) to give green
fluorescence under UV.
