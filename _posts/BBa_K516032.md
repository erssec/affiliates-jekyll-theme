mRFP protein generator TERM+ RBS+(B0032)

  
Red fluorescent protein generator with
[BBa_B0032](http://parts.igem.org/wiki/index.php/Part:BBa_B0032) medium
efficiency RBS (from Community Collection) and double terminator.  
This construct is useful to measure the relative strength of promoters or the
RBS efficiency in relationship with a promoter of interest.  
To build a measurement device it is only necessary assemble a standard
biobrick promoter with this device (or another one of the collection:
[BBa_K516030](http://parts.igem.org/wiki/index.php/Part:BBa_K516030) ;
[BBa_K516031](http://parts.igem.org/wiki/index.php/Part:BBa_K516031))
