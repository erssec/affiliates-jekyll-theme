# Part:BBa_K627011

Designed by: iGEM11 Potsdam_Bioware   Group: iGEM11_Potsdam_Bioware

Fusion part of pBAD arabinose-inducible induction system and the HRV 14_3C
protease  

#### Introduction

This BioBrick is a 2 part fusion of arabinose-inducible induction system and
the HRV 14_3C protease.

#### General Information of the single sub parts

##### HRV 14_3C

The recombinant type 14_3C protease from human rhinovirus (HRV 3C) recognizes
the same cleavage site as the native enzyme: LeuGluValLeuPheGln/GlyPro.  
The 22 kDa protease got its optimal activity at 4°C but also shows a high
cleavage rate at 37°C. The 14_3C works with a catalytic triade, containing the
amino acid residues Ser-Asp-His at its active site.  

##### Arabinose-inducible induction system

The arabinose-inducible induction system was amplified via PCR from the
pBAD_iGEMexpress vector. Based on the inhibitionary funtion of the catabolic
activator protein (CAP) it got a very low expression rate without induction by
arabinose. For the induction concentration between 2 mM up to 50 mM arabinose
can be used to get an high expression rate.

#### General Function

When arabinose is added to the media (2mM up to 50 mM), the CAP lost its
inhibitory function and the arabinose-inducible induction system gets
activated. The protein, here the HRV 14_3C protease, after the T7 RBS gets
express at a very high rate. So we can assume that this system is an effectiv
protease generator.

#### Performance and Summary

In combination with our created ssTorA_CS-14_3C_blaFL device (BBa_K627013,
[More Information](http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K627013)) this protease
generator was able to mediate the cell death of our transformed _E.coli_ cells
at ampicillin concentration up to 100 µg/ml. Sequence and Features

### Burden Imposed by this Part:

no_burden_icon.png)

**Burden Value: -1.4 ± 3.8%**

Burden is the percent reduction in the growth rate of _E. coli_ cells
transformed with a plasmid containing this BioBrick (± values are 95%
confidence limits). This BioBrick did not exhibit a burden that was
significantly greater than zero (i.e., it appears to have little to no impact
on growth). Therefore, users can depend on this part to remain stable for many
bacterial cell divisions and in large culture volumes. Refer to any one of the
[BBa_K3174002](http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K3174002) \-
[BBa_K3174007](http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K3174007) pages for more
information on the methods, an explanation of the sources of burden, and other
conclusions from a large-scale measurement project conducted by the [2019
Austin_UTexas team](http://2019.igem.org/Team:Austin_UTexas).

This functional parameter was added by the [2020 Austin_UTexas
team.](http://2020.igem.org/Team:Austin_UTexas/Contribution)
