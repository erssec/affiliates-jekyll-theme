# Part:BBa_K530008

Designed by: Daniel Wolozny   Group: iGEM11_Johns_Hopkins   (2011-08-15)

TDH3 Yeast Promoter

TDH3 Promoter is used to regulate the expression of genes within the genome of
_Saccharomyces cerevisiae_ or baker's yeast.

### Sequencing

[![TDH3p

This is the sequencing for colony 10. Both colony 1 and 10 were a perfect
match with the genomic DNA promoter.

  

## **CONTRIBUTION**

**[iGEM Kyoto 2017](http://2017.igem.org/Team:Kyoto) ** improved this part by
connecting it with
**[BBa_K1875003(EGFP)](http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K1875003) **, adding
further functions. In this improvement, we obtained a new part
**[BBa_K2403003](http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K2403003) **.

### Combination with BBa_K1875003(EGFP)

We combined this part (BBa_K530008, TDH3 promoter) with
**[BBa_K1875003(EGFP)](http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K1875003) ** to create
the part **[BBa_K2403003](http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K2403003) **, a
constitutive EGFP expression vector for yeast. We validated the plasmid in _S.
cerevisiae,_ and detected a strong green fluorescence under the microscope. (
Please check the figures in **[experience page of this
part](http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K530008:Experience)**. ) In addition, we
confirmed that pine wood nematodes eat _S. cerevisiae_. This innovation
greatly contributed to our project.
