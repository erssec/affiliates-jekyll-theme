pBAD+Theophylline Responsive Riboswitch P1G1 with Native RBS+E0040+B0015

This is a measurement with a theophylline responsive riboswitch and reporter
gene, GFP. The mRNA with a theophylline riboswitch in it would respond to
theophylline concerntration, producing different amount of GFP measured by GFP
fluorescence intensity. In this part, the theophylline responsive riboswitch
contains an original ribosome binding site.
