# Part:BBa_K523003

Designed by: Mun Ching Lee, Sylvia Ispasanie   Group: iGEM11_Edinburgh
(2011-07-29)

malS for BioSandwich

This is a version of
[BBa_K523001](http://parts.igem.org/wiki/index.php/Part:BBa_K523001) but with
no RBS and no stop codon.

There are four extra bases at the end which (together with the standard RFC10
prefix) generate a BglII site. There are two extra bases at the end which,
when combined with the T at the start of the standard RFC10 suffix, code for a
glycine. The effect of both of these features is to provide an in-frame BglII
site at the start, and an in-frame SpeI site at the end (from the standard
suffix). These features are necessary for producing fusion proteins with
Edinburgh 2011's BioSandwich assembly protocol (RFC 81).

### Burden Imposed by this Part:

no_burden_icon.png)

**Burden Value: -1.0 ± 2.8%**

Burden is the percent reduction in the growth rate of _E. coli_ cells
transformed with a plasmid containing this BioBrick (± values are 95%
confidence limits). This BioBrick did not exhibit a burden that was
significantly greater than zero (i.e., it appears to have little to no impact
on growth). Therefore, users can depend on this part to remain stable for many
bacterial cell divisions and in large culture volumes. Refer to any one of the
[BBa_K3174002](http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K3174002) \-
[BBa_K3174007](http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K3174007) pages for more
information on the methods, an explanation of the sources of burden, and other
conclusions from a large-scale measurement project conducted by the [2019
Austin_UTexas team](http://2019.igem.org/Team:Austin_UTexas).

This functional parameter was added by the [2020 Austin_UTexas
team.](http://2020.igem.org/Team:Austin_UTexas/Contribution)
