Tat PROM

# Part:BBa_K895000

Designed by: Frank Sargent   Group: iGEM12_Dundee   (2012-09-21)

Eco_Ptat2

The constitutive promoter region (103 bp) from the _Escherichia coli_ K-12
_tatABCD_ (twin-arginine translocase) operon. This is a constitutive promoter
that gives good levels of expression in _E. coli_ , but is not inducible or
repressible. The promoter region is cloned as an EcoRI / PstI fragment into
pSB1C3 following Biobrick Standard RFC[10]. This is a corrected part that
replaces the
[BBa_K562000](http://parts.igem.org/wiki/index.php/Part:BBa_K562000) biobrick.

### Burden Imposed by this Part:

![](http://parts.igem.org/wiki/images/f/fa/T--Austin_Utexas--
no_burden_icon.png)

**Burden Value: 4.7 ± 5.4%**

Burden is the percent reduction in the growth rate of _E. coli_ cells
transformed with a plasmid containing this BioBrick (± values are 95%
confidence limits). This BioBrick did not exhibit a burden that was
significantly greater than zero (i.e., it appears to have little to no impact
on growth). Therefore, users can depend on this part to remain stable for many
bacterial cell divisions and in large culture volumes. Refer to any one of the
[BBa_K3174002](http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K3174002) \-
[BBa_K3174007](http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K3174007) pages for more
information on the methods, an explanation of the sources of burden, and other
conclusions from a large-scale measurement project conducted by the [2019
Austin_UTexas team](http://2019.igem.org/Team:Austin_UTexas).

This functional parameter was added by the [2020 Austin_UTexas
team.](http://2020.igem.org/Team:Austin_UTexas/Contribution)
