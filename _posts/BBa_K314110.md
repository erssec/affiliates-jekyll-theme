higher bands are phage genomic DNA while the lower bands at roughly 2-3kb
correspond to the expected plasmid size.**

The f1 origin was tested by comparing single strand DNA harvest using part of
the [Kunkel
mutagenesis](http://2010.igem.org/Team:Washington/Protocols/KunkelCapD)
protocol. CJ236 cells were infected with M13K07 helper phage. The CJ236 cells
varied in the present or absence of the f1 origin on the pSB1A3 or pSB3K3
plasmid. The SS DNA harvest was then run on a 50ml 1% agarose gel at 90V for
45minutes. As is clearly visible on the gel to the right single strand DNA of
the plasmid is only made when the f1 origin is present.

  
TecCEM 2015 characterised this biobrick in order to prove the theory of
recovering ssDNA for aim of our project.ssDNA harvesting was done 1, 2, and 3
hours after M13 helper phage infection. This was verified by an agarose gel
electrophoresis as shown in Figure 1, and D.O. (260 nm) was measured for each
sample in order to determine the amount of ssDNA.The latter can be observed on
Figure 2, where the correlation factor and the lineal regression equation are
included. This is considered an indication of the increasing ssDNA plasmid
result of the infection.

The quantification analysis can be observed on Figure 2, where the correlation
factor and the lineal regression equation are included. The yield analysis
could be further modelled with more samples through time.

### Burden Imposed by this Part:

![](http://parts.igem.org/wiki/images/f/fa/T--Austin_Utexas--
no_burden_icon.png)

**Burden Value: -3.5 ± 5.9%**

Burden is the percent reduction in the growth rate of _E. coli_ cells
transformed with a plasmid containing this BioBrick (± values are 95%
confidence limits). This BioBrick did not exhibit a burden that was
significantly greater than zero (i.e., it appears to have little to no impact
on growth). Therefore, users can depend on this part to remain stable for many
bacterial cell divisions and in large culture volumes. Refer to any one of the
[BBa_K3174002](http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K3174002) \-
[BBa_K3174007](http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K3174007) pages for more
information on the methods, an explanation of the sources of burden, and other
conclusions from a large-scale measurement project conducted by the [2019
Austin_UTexas team](http://2019.igem.org/Team:Austin_UTexas).

This functional parameter was added by the [2020 Austin_UTexas
team.](http://2020.igem.org/Team:Austin_UTexas/Contribution)
