rpos leader sequence

This leader sequence originally from the 5'-untranslated RNA of the rpoS gene.
Its particular secondary structure places the ribosome binding site into a
double-stranded region and therefore prevents recognition by the ribosome. A
small RNA, called dsrA can interacts with it and induces a change that
liberates the RBS and thus stimulates the translation the downstream gene.
