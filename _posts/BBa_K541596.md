Reflectin gene with J04500 promoter

  
Lipopolysaccharide (LPS), or endotoxin, is the major mediator of septic shock,
a serious complication of Gram-negative bacterial infections in humans.
Molecules that bind LPS and neutralize its biological effects or enhance its
clearance could have important clinical applications. Limulus anti-LPS factor
(LALF) binds LPS tightly, and, in animal models, reduces mortality when
administered before or after LPS challenge or bacterial infection. The wedge-
shaped molecule has a striking charge distribution and amphipathicity that
suggest how it can insert into membranes. The binding site for LPS probably
involves an extended amphipathic loop, and it has been proposed that two
mammalian LPS-binding proteins will have a similar loop. The amphipathic loop
structure may be used in the design of molecules with therapeutic properties
against septic shock.
