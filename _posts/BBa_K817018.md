# Part:BBa_K817018

Designed by: Shan Chi Hsieh   Group: iGEM12_NTU-Taida   (2012-09-18)

gamma-delta resolvase cassette

This cassette encodes an autoregulated resolvase(serine type recombinase)from
E.coli F plasmid transposon tn1000(tn3 family). Its promoter region consists
of 3 sub-sites(res site) and can process recombination. This cassette can
resolve multimer that formed during replicative transposition, so it can also
resolve plasmid multimer providing plasmid stability by avoiding dimer
catastrophe. For this reason, it is multimer resolution system(MRS) that
provide the same function as E.coli chromosome XerCD/dif but acts independent
of cell cycle and may have higher efficiency on plasmids compared with slow
XerCD system.

## Functional Parameters: Austin_UTexas

### Burden Imposed by this Part:

no_burden_icon.png)

**Burden Value: -1.7 ± 3.7%**

Burden is the percent reduction in the growth rate of _E. coli_ cells
transformed with a plasmid containing this BioBrick (± values are 95%
confidence limits). This BioBrick did not exhibit a burden that was
significantly greater than zero (i.e., it appears to have little to no impact
on growth). Therefore, users can depend on this part to remain stable for many
bacterial cell divisions and in large culture volumes. Refer to any one of the
[BBa_K3174002](http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K3174002) \-
[BBa_K3174007](http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K3174007) pages for more
information on the methods, an explanation of the sources of burden, and other
conclusions from a large-scale measurement project conducted by the [2019
Austin_UTexas team](http://2019.igem.org/Team:Austin_UTexas).

This functional parameter was added by the [2020 Austin_UTexas
team.](http://2020.igem.org/Team:Austin_UTexas/Contribution)
