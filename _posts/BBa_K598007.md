Theophylline Responsive Riboswitch P1G1 with Native RBS+E0040+B0015 This is a
GFP generator with a theophylline responsive riboswitch sequence. The mRNA
with a theophylline riboswitch in it would respond to theophylline
concerntration, producing different amount of GFP measured by GFP fluorescence
intensity. Under the control of different promoters, it could be used to
demonstrate the theophylline responsive curve, providing data for modeling.
The theophylline riboswitch sequence could also be used to modulate other
downstream gene expression. In this part, the theophylline responsive
riboswitch contains an original ribosome binding site.
