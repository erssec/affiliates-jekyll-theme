# Part:BBa_K819010

Designed by: Xing Wenmin   Group: iGEM12_Peking   (2012-09-03)

Medium cheZ generator

CheZ is a significant protein in _E.coli_ chemotaxis pathway. CheZ can prevent
the cells from tumbling around and keep them moving. Deletion of CheZ or
repression of CheZ expression can result in a non-motile phenotype.  
CheZ was placed under a weak promoter
[BBa_J23113](http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_J23113). This part expresses CheZ
protein weakly and induces weak mobility in delta CheZ E.coli strain.

## Functional Parameters: Austin_UTexas

BBa_K819010 parameters

### Burden Imposed by this Part:

![](http://parts.igem.org/wiki/images/f/fa/T--Austin_Utexas--
no_burden_icon.png)

**Burden Value: 2.2 ± 3.4%**

Burden is the percent reduction in the growth rate of _E. coli_ cells
transformed with a plasmid containing this BioBrick (± values are 95%
confidence limits). This BioBrick did not exhibit a burden that was
significantly greater than zero (i.e., it appears to have little to no impact
on growth). Therefore, users can depend on this part to remain stable for many
bacterial cell divisions and in large culture volumes. Refer to any one of the
[BBa_K3174002](http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K3174002) \-
[BBa_K3174007](http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K3174007) pages for more
information on the methods, an explanation of the sources of burden, and other
conclusions from a large-scale measurement project conducted by the [2019
Austin_UTexas team](http://2019.igem.org/Team:Austin_UTexas).

This functional parameter was added by the [2020 Austin_UTexas
team.](http://2020.igem.org/Team:Austin_UTexas/Contribution)
