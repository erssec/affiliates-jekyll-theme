cheZ

# Part:BBa_K629003

Designed by: Zilong WANG, Yi ZHENG   Group: iGEM11_SYSU-China   (2011-10-03)

cheZ, chemotaxis regulator, protein phosphatase for CheY  
  
**Usage and Biology**  
Chemotaxis is the cellâ€™s system for directed movement which allows the cell to
move towards nutrition sources as well as away from toxic substances. The
chemotactic system is a complex chain of phosphorylation reactions. At the end
of the chain is the flagellum-binding protein CheY. The phosphorylated CheY
(CheY-p) binds the flagella and causes the cell to tumble in place,
essentially remaining immotile. The phosphatase CheZ dephosphorylates CheY,
causing CheY to unbind to the flagella, resulting in directed movement of the
cell [1].
