rhiI

# Part:BBa_K594005

a luxI homologous AHL synthetase from Rhzobium leguminosarum bv. vicae IMA57

R. leguminosarum bv. viciae is a best characterized organism in the nitrogen-
fixing rhizobia. Several quorum-sensing systems (rai, rhi, cin,and tra) have
been identified and are intertwined in a complex regulatory network. The rhi
system is composed of rhiR (a luxR homolog),rhiI (a luxI homolog), and the
rhiABC operon, all of which are located on the symbiotic plasmid pRL1JI (29,
139). It was demonstrated that rhiABC was controlled by RhiR and that
flavonoids repressed the expression of both rhiR and rhiABC.
