M256I CysE

# Part:BBa_K731010

Designed by: Jason Fontana, Daniele Rossetto, Giacomo Giacomelli   Group:
iGEM12_TRENTO   (2012-08-20)

M256I CysE (Serine Acetyltransferase)

CysE is an enzyme involved In cysteine biosynthesis, also known as SAT. It
catalyzes the acetylation of serine to give O-acetylserine, the CysE final
precursor. Some O-acetylserine is also converted to N-acetylserine, which in
turn triggers the assimilation of sulfate through specific genes.

M256I CysE shows enhanced secretion of cysteine and is not inhibited by
Cysteine overproduction.

This part has been successfully operated while controlled by araC-pBAD both in
pSB1C3 ([K731030](http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K731030)) and the low copy
vector pSB3C5, in which it was characterized. A sfGFP tagged fusion of this
part has also been deposited as
[K731040](http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K731040) and used to test protein
expression levels upon arabinose induction.  
This part was cloned by the iGEM Trento 2012 team for the creation of an
aerobically engineered pathway for the removal of the black crust disfiguring
marble stones. Further information about this part and its characterization
can be found in the [iGEM Trento 2012 wiki](http://2012.igem.org/Team:UNITN-
Trento).

### Usage and Biology

In _Escherichia coli_ conversion of L-serine to L-cysteine is mediated by the
action of two enzymes: serine acetyltransferase [1] catalyses the activation
of L-serine by acetyl-CoA. Its product, 0-acetyl-L-serine (OAS), is then
subsequently converted to L-cysteine by 0-acetyl-L-serine(thio1)lyase.  
The synthesis of OAS-(thio1)-lyase and of the enzymes involved in sulphate
uptake and reduction is regulated by induction as well as by repression [2].
The expression of cysE (the SAT structural gene), on the other hand, is
constitutive whereas the catalytic activity of the gene product, SAT, is
sensitive to feedback inhibition by L-cysteine [3].

Denk and Bock [4], in a work to develop an _E. coli_ strain able to secrete
cysteine, isolated a M256I cysE mutant that had a 10-fold decrease in feedback
inhibition by cysteine itself, in the end promoting cysteine excretion into
the medium.This particular mutant, thus, would overproduce cysteine,
assimiliting more sulfate to satisfy its needs.

_We demonstrated that[Part
BBa_K731010](http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K731010) works as expected when
operated in the Composite Part
[BBa_K731030](http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K731030), under the control of
araC-pBAD ([BBa_K731201](http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K731201)). NEB10β
cells with and without part
[BBa_K7310130](http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K731030) (i.e. CysE) operated in
the low copy vector pSB3C5 were grown in MOPS, supplemented with K2SO4 and
glucose as carbon source, and induced with 5 mM Arabinose. After overnight
induction a 0.5 mL aliquot was taken from each sample to which it was added
0.5 mL of glacial acetic acid and 0.5 mL of Ninhidrin reagent prepared as
described in our protocol page. Panel A: NEB10β cells before induction (left)
and after overnight induction (right). Panel B: Cells transformed with
[BBA_K731030](http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K731030) before induction (left)
and after overnight induction (right)._
