# Part:BBa_K895004

Designed by: Frank Sargent   Group: iGEM12_Dundee   (2012-09-22)

Salty_Hcp-CD27_endolysin

This is a coding part comprising the full open reading frame of _Salmonella
enterica_ LT2 _hcp_ gene (also known as STM0279 or _tssD_ ) linked _via_ an
haemagglutinin eptitope tag to a synthetic gene encoding an endolysin from the
CD27 bacteriophage. The CD27 endolysin is believed to have high specificity
against the cell wall of _Clostridium difficile_.

### Burden Imposed by this Part:

no_burden_icon.png)

**Burden Value: 2.8 ± 8.0%**

Burden is the percent reduction in the growth rate of _E. coli_ cells
transformed with a plasmid containing this BioBrick (± values are 95%
confidence limits). This BioBrick did not exhibit a burden that was
significantly greater than zero (i.e., it appears to have little to no impact
on growth). Therefore, users can depend on this part to remain stable for many
bacterial cell divisions and in large culture volumes. Refer to any one of the
[BBa_K3174002](http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K3174002) \-
[BBa_K3174007](http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K3174007) pages for more
information on the methods, an explanation of the sources of burden, and other
conclusions from a large-scale measurement project conducted by the [2019
Austin_UTexas team](http://2019.igem.org/Team:Austin_UTexas).

This functional parameter was added by the [2020 Austin_UTexas
team.](http://2020.igem.org/Team:Austin_UTexas/Contribution)
