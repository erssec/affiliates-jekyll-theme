# Part:BBa_K575044

Designed by: Kristin Palarz   Group: iGEM11_Northwestern   (2011-09-22)

Genomic LasR/PAI1 Inducible Promoter + RBS (B0034) + GFP, Cons. Promoter + RBS
(B0030) + LasR

This construct contains a LasR/PaI1 (3-oxo-C12-HSL) inducible promoter from
the _Pseudomonas_ genome with an RBS and a GFP reporter. There is also
constitutive transcription of the LasR receptor protein. Thus, the promoter
will activate and fluorescence will be observed in the presence of PAI1.
