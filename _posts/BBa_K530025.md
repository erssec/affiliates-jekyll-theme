Vtc2

Enzyme in the pathway required for L-Ascorbate Acid Synthesis. This sequence
was taken from plants. It catalyzes the conversion of GDP-L-Galactose to
L-Galactose-1-P.

### Sequencing

[![GLGP
Sequencing.png](/wiki/images/7/79/GLGP_Sequencing.png)](/File:GLGP_Sequencing.png)

This is the sequencing for GLGP. The areas of mismatch in the middle of the
sequence are due to the fact that the gene is too long for only two primers to
sequence adequately.
