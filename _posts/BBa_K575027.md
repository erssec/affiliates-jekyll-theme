# Part:BBa_K575027

Designed by: Kristin Palarz   Group: iGEM11_Northwestern   (2011-09-22)

LasR/PAI1 Inducible Promoter + RBS (B0030) + RFP, Constitutive Promoter + RBS
(B0034) + LasR

This construct contains a LasR/PaI1 (3-oxo-C12-HSL) inducible promoter with an
RBS and an RFP reporter. There is also constitutive transcription of the LasR
receptor protein. Thus, the promoter will activate and fluorescence will be
observed in the presence of PAI1.
