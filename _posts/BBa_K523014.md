# Part:BBa_K523014

Designed by: Sylvia Ispasanie, Mun Ching Lee, Eugene Fletcher   Group:
iGEM11_Edinburgh   (2011-09-08)

Plac + LacZ + bglX

The _E. coli_ periplasmic β-glucosidase gene _bglX_ under the control of the
lac promoter. The native ribosome binding site is present.

### Usage and Biology

The BglX β-glucosidase is expected to be localised to the periplasm. It ought
to be capable of breaking down cellobiose.

#### MUG/MUC experiment

We (Edinburgh 2011) conducted two assays, comparing the activity of this part
_(Plac-bglX)_ with that of the exoglucanase _cex_ under the control of the lac
promoter
([BBa_K523016](http://parts.igem.org/wiki/index.php/Part:BBa_K523016)) on two
different substrates:

  * 4-methylumbelliferyl β\- D- glucuronide **(MUG, left photo)**. This substrate is a cellobiose analog.
  * 4-methylumbelliferyl β\- D- cellobioside **(MUC, right photo)**. This substrate is larger and is more like a cellulose analog.

Both substrates produce a fluorescent product when cleaved. Our plates below
show the results of placing cell lysate and cell debris on an MUG plate and an
MUC plate. Present on both plates are:

  * Left side of plate: lysate/debris from JM109 expressing this part, K523014
  * Right side of plate: lysate/debris from JM109 expressing exoglucanase _cex_ , [BBa_K523016](http://parts.igem.org/wiki/index.php/Part:BBa_K523016)
  * Bottom of plate: lysate/debris from JM109 cells

**MUG assay.** _bglX_ on left, _cex_ on right.  |  | **MUC assay.** _bglX_ on
left, _cex_ on right.  
  
As can be seen, _bglX_ is capable of degrading MUG (the cellobiose analog)
while exoglucanase displays much weaker activity. By contrast, exoglucanase is
much better at degrading MUC.

#### Inability to grow on cellobiose

We tested the ability of _E. coli_ with this part to grow on minimal media
with cellobiose as the only carbon source. It could not. By contrast, it did
grow if glucose was the carbon source, showing that it is fundamentally
capable of growing on minimal media.

### _E.coli_ in fluid media

(characterize by SDU-Denmark)

It was not possible to see any indications of _E.coli_ being capable of living
on cellobiose in fluid media. On the figure below, it is shown that this
biobrick can not make _E.coli_ grow with cellobiose as the only carbon source.
The bglX is compared to another biobrick which have the ability to degrade
cellobiose to glucose

## Functional Parameters: Austin_UTexas

### Burden Imposed by this Part:

![](http://parts.igem.org/wiki/images/7/7a/T--Austin_Utexas--
high_significant_burden.png)

**Burden Value: 39.6 ± 4.7%**

Burden is the percent reduction in the growth rate of _E. coli_ cells
transformed with a plasmid containing this BioBrick (± values are 95%
confidence limits). This part exhibited a significant burden. Users should be
aware that BioBricks with a burden of >20-30% may be susceptible to mutating
to become less functional or nonfunctional as an evolutionary consequence of
this fitness cost. This risk increases as they used for more bacterial cell
divisions or in larger cultures. Users should be especially careful when
combining multiple burdensome parts, as plasmids with a total burden of >40%
are expected to mutate so quickly that they become unclonable. Refer to any
one of the [BBa_K3174002](http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K3174002) \-
[BBa_K3174007](http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K3174007) pages for more
information on the methods and other conclusions from a large-scale
measurement project conducted by the [2019 Austin_UTexas
team.](https://2019.igem.org/Team:Austin_UTexas)

This functional parameter was added by the [2020 Austin_UTexas
team.](https://2020.igem.org/Team:Austin_UTexas/Contribution)
