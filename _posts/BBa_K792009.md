# Part:BBa_K792009

Designed by: Manuel Gim�nez   Group: iGEM12_Buenos_Aires   (2012-09-25)

Yeast exportable His-rich peptide w/enhanced import (1)

This composite device produces and **exports** a **Histidine rich** peptide,
that is **import enhanced** (thanks to a trojan peptide). This device is
intended to be used with **Yeast chassis** , so it is composed by subparts
designed also to be use in yeast.

  
The high level structure of the device is:

  * _**Kozak**_ consensus sequence for initiation of translation _(from yeast α-factor mating pheromone (MFα1))_
  * _**Signal**_ peptide that targets the product of the gene for secretion _(also from yeast α-factor mating pheromone (MFα1))_
  * _**Trojan**_ peptide, to increase internalization in target cell _(from HIV TAT penetratin)_
  * _**Payload**_ : this is the exported **Histidine** rich domain of the protein _(a His-Tag)_

  
The device's sequence has inherited some useful **restriction sites** (
_BamHI_ & _HindIII_ ) from the parts it's made of.

  

**Important note:** |  this part has been submitted to the registry using a
direct synthesis DNA sample, so it does not contain scars from _BB assembly
standard_.

BsAs2012-Biohazard.png)](/File:BsAs2012-Biohazard.png) |  This device contains
[BBa_K792003](http://parts.igem.org/wiki/index.php/Part:BBa_K792003), a trojan
peptide. Extreme your safety measures when dealing with strains containing
this part: **avoid direct contact with them or conditioned medium and discard
them as pathogenic residues.**  
---|---  
The device was originally designed and built to be used in [iGEM BsAs 2012
project](http://2012.igem.org/Team:Buenos_Aires) to implement a _cross-
feeding_ regulatory system between two different yeast strains with specific
auxotrophy. [Visit our wiki](http://2012.igem.org/Team:Buenos_Aires) to read
details about the design process and implementation details. Also feel free to
contact us for any question regarding this part.  |
