This part was submitted by team [Amsterdam
2011](http://2011.igem.org/Team:Amsterdam) as part of their project: _**icE.
coli**_. It was used as a construction intermediate, to create the following
composite parts:

  * [ BBa_K538201](/Part:BBa_K538201 "Part:BBa K538201")
  * [ BBa_K538210](/Part:BBa_K538210 "Part:BBa K538210")
  * [ BBa_K538211](/Part:BBa_K538211 "Part:BBa K538211")
  * [ BBa_K538301](/Part:BBa_K538301 "Part:BBa K538301")
  * [ BBa_K538310](/Part:BBa_K538310 "Part:BBa K538310")
  * [ BBa_K538311](/Part:BBa_K538311 "Part:BBa K538311")

**Results**

As part of charecterization, the iGEM IISER Bhopal 2019 team performed growth
curves at different temperatures in order to study the part which was also a
part of our project.

Cpn 60 was successfully digested from the parent backbone pSB1C3, which was
confirmed on gel via size confirmation and sequencing exercises and inserted
into pUC18

As this part had already been submitted by the 2011 Amsterdam team, we decided
to further characterize it (as a part of the Bronze medal criteria) and check
how its induction affected cell growth. The results of the growth analysis may
be seen in the graphs provided below. The temperatures chosen were 37°C (as a
model for optimal conditions) and 18°C (as a model for suboptimal conditions).
While we ideally would have liked to achieve even lower temperatures (as our
model clearly predicts that TF could survive near 0°C-like conditions), we
were most unfortunately limited by the available infrastructural
facilities.</p>

For confirmation, we also ran a whole cell lysate SDS page with induced Cpn60
cells, this gave a distinct band at approxiamtely 60kDa (actual weight of the
protein is 56,872 Da). The gel image is as seen below

### Burden Imposed by this Part:

![](http://parts.igem.org/wiki/images/f/fa/T--Austin_Utexas--
no_burden_icon.png)

**Burden Value: 1.1 ± 4.7%**

Burden is the percent reduction in the growth rate of _E. coli_ cells
transformed with a plasmid containing this BioBrick (± values are 95%
confidence limits). This BioBrick did not exhibit a burden that was
significantly greater than zero (i.e., it appears to have little to no impact
on growth). Therefore, users can depend on this part to remain stable for many
bacterial cell divisions and in large culture volumes. Refer to any one of the
[BBa_K3174002](http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K3174002) \-
[BBa_K3174007](http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K3174007) pages for more
information on the methods, an explanation of the sources of burden, and other
conclusions from a large-scale measurement project conducted by the [2019
Austin_UTexas team](http://2019.igem.org/Team:Austin_UTexas).

This functional parameter was added by the [2020 Austin_UTexas
team.](http://2020.igem.org/Team:Austin_UTexas/Contribution)
