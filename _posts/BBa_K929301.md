The Potsdam Assembly Standard is a modified PLICing (Phosphorothioate-based
ligase-independent gene cloning) method (Blanusa _et al._ (2010)). For this
standard, we designed a new cloning vector with an RFP expression cassette as
insert. Therefore, we expanded the prefix with an Apa I recognition site and
the suffix with a Sph I recognition site. Both enzymes causing a 3’ overhang
with 4 nucleotides. For the cloning process we cut the vector with Apa I and
Sph I. In this assembly standard that’s the only step where we have to use
restriction enzymes.  
  

Results

  
For culturing E.colis transformed with Potsdam Standard Cloning Vector with
RFP: The red fluorescence of the transformed colonies is obvious after 24 h
incubation at 37 °C and over night incubation at 8 °C. To speed up the
cloning, you can use LED light to see red fluorescence even after 16 h
incubation at 37 °C. The transformed E.colis don't need any IPTG for RFP
production. For the over night culture (fig. 1), we observed that it is better
to incubate them with IPTG. After centrifugation, you can see the cerry-like
cell pellets (fig. 3).

Experimental Design: How to clone with the Potsdam Standard?

  
The insert is amplified with primers that contain 4 phosphothioate
nuclheotides and the recognition sites for Apa I and Sph I at the 5’ end.
After incubation in an iodine/ethanol solution, the thiophosphates were cut
out resulting in a 3’ overhang which is suitable to the overhangs that was
created by cutting the Potsdam Standard vector. After that, the digested
vector and the PLICed insert are mixed and transformed into _E. coli_
(Summary: fig. 1). By using the RFP expression cassette (fig. 2), we created a
ligation control system. Due to the fact that red fluorescent colonies have a
failed vector ligation we can tell which colonies are correctly ligated. The
colonies that do not show red fluorescence are the positive clones.
