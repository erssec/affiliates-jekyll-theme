pYMB(Fig. 1) is described to contain the ori (origin of replication), rep gene
(required for replication) of pMGT. Once the synthetic work had been done,
pYMB is constructed by equipping the ori, the appropriate promoter for AMB-1
(Pmms16 and Pmsp3 as our candidate) and rep gene on the commercial plasmid
pUG19 which was revised as the expression of Biobrick backbone psB1A1with
promotor Pmsp1. The constructed vector is capable of replicating within both
E. coli and AMB-1, fully sufficing a competent shuttle vector for genetic
engineering the magnetotactic bateria.

### Burden Imposed by this Part:

no_burden_icon.png)

**Burden Value: -1.3 ± 0.7%**

Burden is the percent reduction in the growth rate of _E. coli_ cells
transformed with a plasmid containing this BioBrick (± values are 95%
confidence limits). This BioBrick did not exhibit a burden that was
significantly greater than zero (i.e., it appears to have little to no impact
on growth). Therefore, users can depend on this part to remain stable for many
bacterial cell divisions and in large culture volumes. Refer to any one of the
[BBa_K3174002](http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K3174002) \-
[BBa_K3174007](http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K3174007) pages for more
information on the methods, an explanation of the sources of burden, and other
conclusions from a large-scale measurement project conducted by the [2019
Austin_UTexas team](http://2019.igem.org/Team:Austin_UTexas).

This functional parameter was added by the [2020 Austin_UTexas
team.](http://2020.igem.org/Team:Austin_UTexas/Contribution)
