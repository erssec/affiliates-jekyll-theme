This part conteins gvpC-20psi protein

This part conteins gvpA protein's coding sequence. This gene from Planktothrix
rubescens can be succesfully expressed in E. coli. The gvpA's expression have
been examined by another part " J23106+B0034+gvpA+B0015". (Since it was
ligated on cloning vector pSB4A5, we didn't register this part. The gvpA
protein conteins a typical domain of the superfamily 'Gas vesicle'(NCBI CDD
cl02594). This gene is quiet conserved in most gvp's polycistron. According to
Anthony E. Walsby's research, gas vesicles have a similar morphology. GvpA
protein is a kind of small hydrophobic protein which forms the ribs of the
main structure. 'All cyanobacterial gas vesicles so far analyzed contain a
protein (GvpA) of about 7.4 kDa that forms the main mass of the structure and
must be responsible for many of its properties.' (Gas Vesicles.
Microbiological Reviews. A. E. Walsby)
