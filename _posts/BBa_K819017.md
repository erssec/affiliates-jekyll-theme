# Part:BBa_K819017

Designed by: YU Zhou   Group: iGEM12_Peking   (2012-09-16)

Luminesensor repressible SulA408 promoter

SulA promoter in 408 form.  
SulA promoter belongs to the SOS regulon family. In _E.coli_ it promotes the
transcription of SulA protein. LexA protein in _E.coli_ can bind to SulA
promoter, inhibiting the transcription of the genes downstream.  
However, with mutations in specific sites which LexA protein will bind to,
SulA408 promoter will not be bound by LexA protein, but is compatible to
LexA408 protein with corresponding mutations in DNA binding site. So a bio-
orthogonal promoter is formed because the influence of endogenous LexA protein
is excluded.  
For example, the optimized _Luminesensor_ with a LexA408 domain
([BBa_K819005](http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K819005)) constructed by [Peking
2012 iGEM team](http://2012.igem.org/Team:Peking) can specifically bind to
SulA408 promoter and therefore inhibit the gene expression (e.g.
[BBa_K819006](http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K819006) is a testing device
containing SulA408 promoter constructed by Peking 2012 iGEM team)

### Burden Imposed by this Part:

![](http://parts.igem.org/wiki/images/f/fa/T--Austin_Utexas--
no_burden_icon.png)

**Burden Value: 2.7 ± 3.2%**

Burden is the percent reduction in the growth rate of _E. coli_ cells
transformed with a plasmid containing this BioBrick (± values are 95%
confidence limits). This BioBrick did not exhibit a burden that was
significantly greater than zero (i.e., it appears to have little to no impact
on growth). Therefore, users can depend on this part to remain stable for many
bacterial cell divisions and in large culture volumes. Refer to any one of the
[BBa_K3174002](http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K3174002) \-
[BBa_K3174007](http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K3174007) pages for more
information on the methods, an explanation of the sources of burden, and other
conclusions from a large-scale measurement project conducted by the [2019
Austin_UTexas team](http://2019.igem.org/Team:Austin_UTexas).

This functional parameter was added by the [2020 Austin_UTexas
team.](http://2020.igem.org/Team:Austin_UTexas/Contribution)
