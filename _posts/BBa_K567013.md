# Part:BBa_K567013

Designed by: Bin Zhao   Group: iGEM11_SJTU-BioX-Shanghai   (2011-09-29)

tRNA(Asp)-TAG

tRNA(Asp) with its anticodon mutated to CUA (base pairing stop codon UAG) and
under the control of _aspV_ promoter. This biobrick is constructed first by
cloning the tRNA(Asp) from _aspV_ in E.coli, then the anticodon region is
site-directed mutated.

  

### Construction of BBa_K567013

This biobrick is constructed first by cloning the tRNAAsp from _aspV_ in
_E.coli_ , then the anticodon region is site-directed mutated. This part is
constructed on the backbone plasmid pACYC184.

### Characterization of BBa_K567013

This part acts as a stop codon suppressor tRNA. It can be charged with Asp.

We have used P _bla_ -Luc-TAG
([BBa_K567003](http://parts.igem.org/wiki/index.php?title=Part:BBa_K567003))
as our Reporter. The amount of luciferase produced is reflected using the
bioluminescence emitted during the luciferin reaction. Our results demonstrate
that TAG insertion into luciferase blocks luciferase production, which was
shown in the control group. In the experimental group, with the help of
PT7-TDRS([BBa_K567011](http://parts.igem.org/wiki/index.php?title=Part:BBa_K567011))
and tRNAAsp-
TAG([BBa_K567013](http://parts.igem.org/wiki/index.php?title=Part:BBa_K567013)),luciferase
was produced and bioluminescence was emitted during the luciferin reaction.
These results proved that **Stop-Codon Switch can turn on protein
expression.**

_Fig.1_ Functional Analysis of Stop-Codon Switch. ER2566 cannot produce
luciferase with Pbla-Luc-TAG
([BBa_K567003](http://parts.igem.org/wiki/index.php?title=Part:BBa_K567003))
only. When PT7-TDRS
([BBa_K567011](http://parts.igem.org/wiki/index.php?title=Part:BBa_K567011))
and tRNAAsp-TAG
([BBa_K567013](http://parts.igem.org/wiki/index.php?title=Part:BBa_K567013))
are also transformed into the cell, luciferase is produced. The results proved
Stop-Codon Switch as a strict molecular switch without background noise.
