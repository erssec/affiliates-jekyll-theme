# Part:BBa_K516030

Designed by: Nicolo' Politi, Federica Sampietro, Davide Bianchini   Group:
iGEM11_UNIPV-Pavia   (2011-09-08)

mRFP protein generator TERM+ RBS+(B0030)

  
Red fluorescent protein generator with
[BBa_B0030](http://parts.igem.org/wiki/index.php/Part:BBa_B0030) high
efficiency RBS (from Community Collection) and double terminator.  
This construct is useful to measure the relative strength of promoters or the
RBS efficiency in relationship with a promoter of interest.  
To build a measurement device is only necessary assemble a standard biobrick
promoter with this device (or another one of the collection:
[BBa_K516031](http://parts.igem.org/wiki/index.php/Part:BBa_K516031) ;
[BBa_K516032](http://parts.igem.org/wiki/index.php/Part:BBa_K516032))

### Burden Imposed by this Part:

![](http://parts.igem.org/wiki/images/f/fa/T--Austin_Utexas--
no_burden_icon.png)

**Burden Value: 1.3 ± 2.5%**

Burden is the percent reduction in the growth rate of _E. coli_ cells
transformed with a plasmid containing this BioBrick (± values are 95%
confidence limits). This BioBrick did not exhibit a burden that was
significantly greater than zero (i.e., it appears to have little to no impact
on growth). Therefore, users can depend on this part to remain stable for many
bacterial cell divisions and in large culture volumes. Refer to any one of the
[BBa_K3174002](http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K3174002) \-
[BBa_K3174007](http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K3174007) pages for more
information on the methods, an explanation of the sources of burden, and other
conclusions from a large-scale measurement project conducted by the [2019
Austin_UTexas team](http://2019.igem.org/Team:Austin_UTexas).

This functional parameter was added by the [2020 Austin_UTexas
team.](http://2020.igem.org/Team:Austin_UTexas/Contribution)
