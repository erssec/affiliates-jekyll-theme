AID is known to be responsible for somatic hypermutation and the class-switch
recombination of immunoglobulin in B cells. This enzyme of 28 kDa originally
occurs in B cells but does also show activity after transfection into CHO
cells. AID induces the deamination of cytidine to uridine at actively
transcribed single strand DNA. The replacement of cytidine by uridine leads to
a mismatch during DNA replication and integrates a single base substitution
predominantly in the immunoglobulin genes.  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  

Cloning with Potsdam Standard

  
To generate this part, we used the [Potsdam
Standard](http://2012.igem.org/Team:Potsdam_Bioware/Project/Potsdam_Standard)
for cloning the AID into the [Potsdam Standard
Backbone](http://parts.igem.org/wiki/index.php?title=Part:BBa_K929301). Here,
we tested four different ligation conditions: 1. with electrophoretic
unpurified, digested Potsdam Standard backbone with and without ligase and 2.
with electrophoretic purified digested Potsdam Standard backbone with and
without ligase. To compute the efficiency, we counted the colonies without and
with red fluorescence indicating a failed ligation reaction (fig. 1). The
results are summarized in fig. 2. We can see that with ligase the ligation
success is much higher than without, and that a electrophoretic purification
of the backbone improve the ligation efficiency.
