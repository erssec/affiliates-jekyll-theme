# Part:BBa_K592002

Designed by: Erik Lundin   Group: iGEM11_Uppsala-Sweden   (2011-09-09)

ccaR

The response regulator ccaR is part of the two-component system (TCS) involved
in the eventual transcriptional output of an adjacent phycobilisome-related
gene (cpcG2) in response to green light of wavelength 535nm. The system is
native to Synechocystis sp. PCC6803 but has been successfully expressed in
E.coli (Hirose et al. 2008) and has been further used in multichromatic
control of gene expression (Tabor et al. 2011). CcaR, alongside the membrane-
associated histidine kinase ccaS, functions as a photoreversible switch
between green (535nm) and red (672nm) light by regulation of the output
promoter PcpcG2. Within the N-terminal GAF domain of ccaS, the blue phycobilin
chromophore phycocyanobilin (PCB) binds to a conserved cysteine residue,
imparting reversible photoactivation of signalling activity. Absorption of
green light increases the rate of ccaS autophosphorylation and phosphotransfer
to ccaR. Once phosphotransfer has occurred, ccaR binds to an operator site
within the sequence of the output promoter PcpcG2. Transcription of the output
gene is then activated.

## BBa_K3634017

St Andrews iGEM 2020 carried out further codon optimisation for E.coli for the
whole BBa_K592002 sequence using the IDT codon optimisation tool. Optimisation
created no new illegal restriction sites allowing the part
([BBa_K3634017](http://parts.igem.org/wiki/index.php/Part:BBa_K3634017)) to be
used at RFC[10] and RFC[1000] standard with codon optimisation.

under UV light. The pSR58.6 plasmid contains CcaR and superfolder GFP. The
pNO286-3 plasmid contains the mini-CcaS gene, along with ho1 and pcyA.
