# Part:BBa_K592026

Designed by: Lei Sun   Group: iGEM11_Uppsala-Sweden   (2011-09-21)

  
J23101-B0032-BFP

Reference promoter
[BBa_J23101](http://parts.igem.org/wiki/index.php/Part:BBa_J23101) for testing
the promoter strength coupled with BFP
(([BBa_K592100](http://parts.igem.org/wiki/index.php/Part:BBa_K592100))). Once
this is cloned into pSB3K3 backbone one can measure the BFP output and use it
as reference value to measure the promoter strength of other promoters.
