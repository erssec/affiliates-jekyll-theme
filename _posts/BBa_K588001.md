# Part:BBa_K588001

Designed by: Kevin Lu   Group: iGEM11_Rutgers   (2011-09-26)

ptrp

Tryptophan promoter and operator

### Usage and Biology

ptrp is a promoter with the trp operator. It will be repressed by trpR
(K588000) and LovTAP.

Note that the trp operator contains two SpeI sites which are critical for trpR
binding. Thus, using UNAM 2010's idea, we cloned the part with an NheI site in
the suffix instead of the SpeI site. When using this BioBrick, be sure to
ligate it last and use NheI instead of SpeI.

This part is a clone of K360023

### Burden Imposed by this Part:

no_burden_icon.png)

**Burden Value: 1.2 ± 5.6%**

Burden is the percent reduction in the growth rate of _E. coli_ cells
transformed with a plasmid containing this BioBrick (± values are 95%
confidence limits). This BioBrick did not exhibit a burden that was
significantly greater than zero (i.e., it appears to have little to no impact
on growth). Therefore, users can depend on this part to remain stable for many
bacterial cell divisions and in large culture volumes. Refer to any one of the
[BBa_K3174002](http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K3174002) \-
[BBa_K3174007](http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K3174007) pages for more
information on the methods, an explanation of the sources of burden, and other
conclusions from a large-scale measurement project conducted by the [2019
Austin_UTexas team](http://2019.igem.org/Team:Austin_UTexas).

This functional parameter was added by the [2020 Austin_UTexas
team.](http://2020.igem.org/Team:Austin_UTexas/Contribution)
