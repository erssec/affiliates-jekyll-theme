# Part:BBa_K741006

Designed by: Wuyang Chen   Group: iGEM12_USTC-China   (2012-07-24)

RBS-crogfp-T

It is a fusion protein of Cro and GFP. The linker between the two protein is
GGSG (BBa_K648005). We use this part to test the ability of anticro to repress
the expression of cro, for crogfp can both be repressed by asRNA of cro and
emit green fluorescence.
