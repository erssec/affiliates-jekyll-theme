# Part:BBa_K346004

Designed by: Junyi Jiao   Group: iGEM10_Peking   (2010-10-14)

RBS(B0034)_MBP(lead metal binding peptide egineered from
PbrR)+Terminator(B0015)

  
This part was designed to function as lead binding peptide in our project. It
was designed to be expressed in the cytosol but when fused with the periplasm
protein DsbA and membrane protein Lpp-OmpA, it will be expressed and
translocated to the periplasm and membrane, respectively. In short, this part
functions as a basic lead binding peptide part in our project.

### Description

[![MerR family.jpg](/wiki/images/e/ec/MerR_family.jpg)](/File:MerR_family.jpg)

  
MerR family TFs share a high similarity at the C-terminal metal binding
domain, which indicates a similar metal recognition mechanism and metal-
protein complex structure. Previous work shows that C-terminal metal binding
domain can act as a metal accumulator without the help of the N-terminal DNA
binding domain. Function test of mercury MBP showed that our whole-cell
bioabsorbents can absorb more than 50% of 10-6 M Hg (II) in 120 minutes,
indicating that cells expressing certain metal binding peptide engineered via
our method can decontaminate corresponding metal ion from aquatic environment.
This design has been successfully applied to another homolog of MerR family â€“
PbrR, the lead responsive regulator. In our project, we tried to tandem two
copies of metal binding domains together to make a high performance and less
energy consuming metal binding peptide. Our bacteria achieved an equivalent
lead accumulation capacity as the mercury MBP, which proved validness of our
engineering strategy. This part worked as the core part in the lead
bioabsorption device.

The figure shows the structure of PbrR and MBP(lead). The left is the
structure of PbrR, a member of MerR family and the right shows the predicted
structure of resulted metal binding peptide, which was engineered from PbrR.
Lead ions are indicated as black balls in metal binding pockets.
