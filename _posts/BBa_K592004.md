YF1

# Part:BBa_K592004

Designed by: Lei Sun   Group: iGEM11_Uppsala-Sweden   (2011-09-17)

YF1 blue-light sensor protein

YF1 is a fusion protein of YtvA ( _B subtilis_ ) and FixL ( _B japonicum_ ).
It contains the N-terminal region of YtvA (1-127) and C-terminal region of
FixL (258-505), interconnected by a helical linker. This fusion protein is
designed by Andreas Moglich and Keith Moffat. In their article (see
references) they showed that illumination of the fusion kinase YF1 reduced net
kinase activity by âˆ¼1000-fold in vitro. They also showed that YF1 also
controls gene expression in a light-dependent manner in vivo.
